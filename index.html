        <h3>Diamonds: No Liver Of Life (Views Do Not Occur)</h3>
        <h3>Royal Salt Merchant</h3>
        <h3>11/6/2020</h3>
        <h3>NO LIVER OF LIFE!</h3>
        <br>
        <p><i>&quot;Subhuti, if someone says that the Buddha expounds the notion of self, the notion of a person, the notion of a being, or the notion of a liver of life<em>, do you think this person understands the principles I expound?&quot;</em></i></p>
        <p><i>&quot;World Honored One, this person does not understand the principles expounded by the Realized One. Why? The World Honored one says that the notion of self, the notion of person, the notion of a being, and the notion of a liver of life are not a notion of self, a notion of a person, a notion of a being, or a notion of a liver of life<em>,</em> they are called the notion of a self, the notion of a person, the notion of a being, and the notion of a liver of life.&quot;</i></p>
        <p><i>(Quote from the Diamond Sutra within Hui-neng&#39;s commentary on the diamond sutra from &quot;The Sutra of Hui-Neng&quot; Translated by Thomas Cleary)</i></p>
        <br>
        <p>What are the Implications of this matter of there being &quot;no liver of life&quot;?
        A mind, previously believing itself to be the controller(&quot;a liver of life&quot;) of the body/brain, has built up many habits for coping with the fears of “mismanagement”. This mind can witness itself going about these coping habits and notice that, since it no longer recognizes itself as a controller(&quot;a liver of life&quot;), these habits, of trying to maintain a notion of control, are simply a waste of energy.</p>
        <p>Already there has been a return back to an earlier state of mind which does not assert this notion of a self.
        When thoughts come by, it begins to question the usefulness of that pattern. If that pattern is not so useful under the new premise, or “no-premise”, it seems to fade from continuing. The mind, watching patterns, allows the brain to gain more insight into the patterns being watched. If the mind attempts to override the brain in its decision making, there is a dissonance, since the mind ultimately has no control, and it stumbles over itself with frustration in futility. The mind does not have this ability.</p>
        <p>The mind, recognizing that it’s own nature is not to make decisions(&quot;no liver of life&quot;) but to observe, in accordance, it develops new(or perhaps &quot;original/ordinary&quot;) habits, which involve anxiety less and less. The mind, which is seated in its home position of awareness (having returned to ordinary), reflects the information it may witness back to the brain with clarity. This “unbecoming”, of releasing unnecessary mental patterns, can take awhile as the mind has to be witness to its own machinations through self-reflection. The more it corrects, the quieter it becomes; the quieter it becomes, the less time is needed for reflecting on habits which no longer are viewed as useful.</p>
        <p>Energy redirected.</p>
        <br>
        <p>How does one cease this activity and redirect energy?
        What do we call this original mind which is not wasting energy? Lets look at Joshu and Nansen....</p>
        <br>
        <p><i>The master asked Nan-ch&#39;uan(Nansen), &quot;What is the Way?&quot;</p>
        <p><em>Nan-ch&#39;uan said, &quot;</em>Ordinary mind is the Way.&quot;</p>
        <p>The master said, &quot;Then may I direct myself towards it or not?&quot;</p>
        <p>Nan-ch&#39;uan said, &quot;To seek [it] is to deviate [from it].&quot;</p>
        <p>The master said, &quot;If I do not seek, how can I know about the Way?&quot;</p>
        <p>Nan-chu&#39;an said, &quot;The Way does not belong to knowing or not knowing. To know is to have a concept; to not know is to be ignorant. If you truly realize the Way of no doubt, it is just like the sky: wide open vast emptiness. How can you say &#39;yes&#39; or &#39;no&#39; to it?&quot;</p>
        <p>At these words the master had sudden enlightenment. His mind became like the clear moon.</p>
        <p>(Recorded sayings of zen master Joshu translated by James Green)</i></p>
        <br>
        <p>His mind became LIKE the clear moon, it reflected back to him with clarity.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Patterns(concepts) created by observation can be most useful when they aren’t taken as ultimate!
        Remembering that patterns are originated from the mind, and that, outside this pattern recognition there are no myriad things or events, the mind knows its own fallibility and cannot rely upon its own nature to the fullest. Knowing it’s fallibility, it knows that it ultimately “does not know”. In this way, It can use “knowing” without being attached to “knowing”, and be seated in “unknowing”. It is &quot;not blind to causality&quot;.</p>
        <p>However recognizing that it’s ability to create patterns, it recognizes that this nature is what allows it to provide the brain with information which can be used for survival and living, therefore being able to trust that it’s own nature is enough to maintain a reasonable reliance (but not totally abiding in) in its own “knowing”, and in this reliance, also not being attached to “unknowing”. Not being attached to it’s own knowing or it’s unknowing, &quot;trusting&quot; that both exist to maintain this life. It goes about in its “normal”(ordinary) state regardless of what may happen.</p>
        <p>Knowing or unknowing, it knows this way, or that way, is still the way; either way will have to do! And either or may occur! Simply avoiding picking and choosing, not attempting to interfere with the outcome which manifests as the body’s action.</p>
        <br>
        <p>More from Joshu on &quot;Picking and Choosing&quot;</p>
        <br>
        <p><i>Chao-chou, teaching the assembly, said, “The Ultimate Path is without difficulty; just avoid picking and choosing. As soon as there are words spoken, ‘this is picking and choosing, this is clarity.’ This old monk does not abide within clarity; do you still preserve anything or not?”</p>
        <p>At that time a certain monk asked, “Since you do not abide within clarity, what do you preserve?”</p>
        <p>Chao-chou replied, “I don’t know either.”</p>
        <p>The monk said, “Since you don’t know, Teacher, why do you nevertheless say that you do not abide within clarity?”</p>
        <p>Chao-chou said, “It is enough to ask about the matter; bow and withdraw.”</p>
        <p>(Blue Cliff Record, Case 2)</i></p>
        <br>
        <p>another example of this in more detail which also sets zen apart from other sects of Buddhism...</p>
        <br>
        <p><i>That which is called the Mirror of Concentration and Wisdom (another reference to non-Zen Mahayana doctrine) requires the use of sight, hearing, feeling and cognition, which lead to successive states of calm and agitation. But these involve conceptions based on environmental objects; they are temporary expedients appertaining to one of the lower categories of &#39;roots of goodness&#39;. And this category of &#39;roots of goodness&#39; merely enables people to understand what is said to them. If you wish to experience Enlightenment yourselves, you must not indulge in such conceptions<em>. They are all environmental Dharmas concerning things which are and things which are</em> not, based on existence and non-existence. If only you will avoid concepts of existence and non-existence in regard to absolutely everything<em>, you will then perceive the Dharma.</em></p>
        <p>(HuangPo, on theTransmission of Mind translated by John Blofeld)</i></p>
        <br>
        <p>&quot;existence AND non-existence&quot; neither completely abiding in &quot;knowing&quot; or &quot;unknowing&quot;</p>
        <br>
        <p>“Ordinary mind is the way”
        Attempting to go beyond ordinary mind and “override” the decisions of the brain/body, is the futility that creates a state of anxiety which is the cause of self-induced oppression. The mind, having become full of fear, makes a futile attempt to act outside of its own nature. A mind which is in a state of anxiety, goes seeking to gain the ability to become in control, which it cannot do, and will believe all sorts of ridiculousness as promoted by self-proclaimed authorities on the subject of self-improvement.</p>
        <p>These authorities are responsible for the propagation of fear in order to manipulate people into a state of anxiety so that they can string them along in a wild goose chase for enlightenment. Contemporary civilization is built on this form of deception and has created a global identity which does not understand its own nature. It constantly seeks to become something that it is not ever going to be. It is never satisfied, and suffers tremendous hell, regardless of its overwhelming abundance and success.</p>
        <p>Get up and Return Home, your efforts are in vain.</p>

        <p><i>(Record of LinJi; Cleary translation)</i></p>
        <br>
            <p><i>“You people must not mistake what I say. [You will go wrong] if you seize upon the words in this old teacher’s mouth and think they are the real Path; if you think you as people of ordinary mentality cannot presume to try to fathom or assess the inconceivable lessons of an enlightened teacher and experienced adept. As soon as you adopt this opinion, you have turned your back on this eye of enlightenment [within us all]. Then you are shivering cold and speechless like a baby donkey on a hill of ice.&quot;
            (Record of LinJi; Sasaki translation)</i></p>
            <br>
            <p><i>“Followers of the Way, you seize upon words from the mouths of those old masters and take them to be the true Way. You think, ‘These good teachers are wonderful, and I, simple-minded fellow that I am, don’t dare measure such old worthies.’ Blind idiots! You go through your entire life holding such views, betraying your own two eyes. Trembling with fright, like donkeys on an icy path, [you say to yourselves,] ‘I don’t dare disparage these good teachers for fear of making karma with my mouth!’&quot;

            <p>Zen is like a virus.</p>
            <p>It&#39;s hard to learn even a little bit about Zen and not be instantly curious.</p>
            <p>Even people who come here and hate Zen, and hate what the Zen Masters had to say, still pretend to speak on behalf of Zen.</p>
            <p>The &quot;Zen&quot; market brings in billions of dollars per year for many greedy (and some honest) pockets, and all the coolest Samurai and &quot;Mystical Eastern Sage&quot; stuff borrows from the legends of the Zen Masters.</p>
            <p>I mean, people even attribute the creation of Kung Fu to BodhiDharma!</p>
            <p>Not that I blame them ... just look how badass his collector&#39;s card looks!</p>
            <p>Everyone wants to be like Zen.</p>
            <p>But Zen is the honey badger of human spiritual traditions (citation necessary?)</p>
            <p>Zen doesn&#39;t care if you understand it.</p>
            <p>Zen is not subject to your whims or desires.</p>
            <p>Zen is Zen by its own defitinition.</p>
            <p>The only way to know Zen is to find out for yourself.</p>
            <p>So here we have LinJi, blabbing on about what Zen is, while also telling you--in no uncertain terms--NOT to take his word for it.</p>
            <p>But if you want to know what Zen is ... if you think BodhiDharma is so fucking badass or that this forum is full of a bunch of deluded cult-worshippers and YOU have the REAL lowdown on what Zen is ... you cannot fucking help yourself.</p>
            <p>You cannot help but go to LinJi&#39;s words and try to understand what LinJi understood ... no matter how much you may hate what he has to say.</p>
            <p>And then it&#39;s too late for you. You&#39;ve caught the virus.</p>
            <p>Now you might as well study Zen while you&#39;re here!</p>

    <h3>10/16/2020</h3>
    <p><i>At the evening gathering the master addressed the assembly, saying:

        “Sometimes I take away the person but do not take away the surroundings; sometimes I take away the surroundings but do not take away the person; sometimes I take away both person and surroundings; sometimes I take away neither person nor surroundings.”
        
        </i></p>
    <p><i>Then a monk asked, “What about ‘to take away the person and not take away the surroundings’?”

        The master said:
        
        The spring sun comes forth, covering the earth with brocade;/A child’s hair hangs down, white as silken strands.</i></p>
    <p><i>The monk asked, “What about ‘to take away the surroundings and not take away the person’?”

        The master said:
        
        The rule of the sovereign prevails throughout the land;/The general has laid to rest the dusts of battle beyond the frontiers.</i></p>
    <p><i>Again the monk asked, “What about ‘to take away both person and surroundings’?”

        The master said:
        
        No news from Bing and Fen,/Isolated and away from everywhere.</i></p>
    <p><i>The monk asked, “What about ‘to take away neither person nor the surroundings’?”

        The master said:
        
        The sovereign ascends into the jeweled palace;/Aged rustics sing songs.</i></p>
    <br>
    <p>Going to the West, we find the Buddha-eye of the Indian Patriachs./Where is there dust, if no mirror?/Naturally moving, without concepts,/the world is a jewel.</p>
    <p>Going to the East, the body is perfected;/the mountain paths are chanced, the Pure Lands swept clean./What use is there polishing a tile into a mirror?/Removing distractions, liberation of will is achieved, and peace follows.</p>
    <p>Going to the North, we find the wooden blocks of silent illumination,/undisturbed by the possibility of reflection./Though war may threaten at the gates, how is one to see over a 1000 mile wall?/Rest reigns supreme, and all cares are dislodged.</p>
    <p>Following Deshan to the South, dust and jewels are found everywhere one turns./What extra thing can be discovered?/The Master finds their home, and the Layman makes a joke,/never asking for more.</p>
    <br>
    <p><b>With brutal clarity, Linji lays the entire thing at our feet:</b></p>
    <br>
    <p><i>Then the master said, “Nowadays, he who studies buddhadharma must seek true insight. Gaining true insight, he is not affected by birth-and-death, but freely goes or stays. He needn’t seek the excellent—that which is excellent will come of itself.

        “Followers of the Way, our eminent predecessors from of old have all had their ways of saving people. As for me, what I want to make clear to you is that you must not accept the deluded views of others. If you want to act, then act. Don’t hesitate.
        
        “Students today can’t get anywhere. What ails you? Lack of faith in yourself is what ails you. If you lack faith in yourself, you’ll keep on tumbling along, following in bewilderment aft er all kinds of circumstances and being taken by them through transformation after transformation without ever attaining freedom.
        
        “Bring to rest the thoughts of the ceaselessly seeking mind, and you will not differ from the patriarch-buddha. Do you want to know the patriarch-buddha? He is none other than you who stand before me listening to my discourse. But because you students lack faith in yourselves, you run around seeking something outside. Even if, through your seeking, you did find something, that something would be nothing more than fancy descriptions in written words; never would you gain the mind of the living patriarch. Make no mistake, worthy Chan men! If you don’t find it here and now, you’ll go on transmigrating through the three realms for myriads of kalpas and thousands of lives, and, held in the clutch of captivating circumstances, be born in the wombs of asses or cows."</i></p>

    <h3><u>TRUST IN HEART-MIND (Jungle_Toad Remix)</u></h3>
    <h3>Jungle Toad</h3>
    <h3>8/22/2020</h3>
    <h4>Introduction:</h4>
    <p>So, I decided to do my own interpretation of the 3rd Patriarch's (Seng Ts'an's) famous poem, the Hsin Hsin Ming (aka Faith in Mind Inscription, aka Trust in Heart-Mind, aka Song of Enlightenment, etc.). My version is written to sound like a surfer dude. Why did I do this? I don't know. I thought it would be funny, and I thought it would be a good exercise for myself to study the various versions of the poem and try to put the phrases in everyday language, so I could better understand it. Because discussions about zen are inherently contradictory and confusing, it is naturally esoteric. Nevertheless, it is fundamentally not meant to be elitist. This is one of the things I love about zen. It's for everyone, even if not everyone understands it. I had that in mind while working on this project. I hope you have fun with it, as I did in making it.</p>
    <p>There are many translations available out there. I based my remix largely on Blyth's, Cleary's, Waley's, and Wonderwheel's. I had a bunch of tabs open while trying to figure out how to phrase each line.</p>
    <p><i>Original poem (Hsin Hsin Ming) by Seng Ts’an, the 3rd Zen Patriarch</i></p>
    <h4>Jungle Toad Remix:</h4>
    <p>The Supreme Way is like not even hard.

        Just stop being a fussmuppet, wanting everything your own way.
        
        Don’t obsess about shit. Don’t hate shit.
        
        Then you’ll start to grok it.
        
        …</p>
    <p>If you’re like a smidge off though… Dayumn!

        Bruh, you get totally pitted!
        
        If you’re gonna surf that shit right, homie,
        
        Just don’t be anti all the time… but like, don’t be a fanboy/fangirl either
        
        …</p>
    <p>Bitching about what you want and what you don’t,

        That’s just stupid ass head games you play in your own mind.
        
        If you keep pushing to figure out what’s up,
        
        Then there’s no point in even trying to get yourself to be chill.
        
        …</p>
    <p>When you really know what’s up, it’s like this cosmic space thing.

        You don’t need stuff because you already have all you need.
        
        For reals! It’s only cuz you’re like “Yay! I want this!” or “Wah! I don’t like that!”,
        
        That you don’t see what I’m talking about.
        
        …</p>
    <p>Don’t try to force the vibes to happen,

        But don’t just zone out like some crackhead either.
        
        Just be mellow and don’t worry too much about it.
        
        It’s cool. Shit just kind of sorts itself out
        
        …</p>
    <p>When you hit the brakes and come to full stop,

        Then you’re “driving” by idling.
        
        If you only use the gas pedal or only use the brakes,
        
        Then you don’t know what you’re doing behind the wheel, dufus! Ha ha!
        
        …</p>
    <p>All this shit goes together.

        If you’re all about just doing shit, or just not doing shit: Epic fail!
        
        If you try to bail on everything, then you’re not keepin it real either.
        
        If you’re too open minded,
        
        Your brain falls out and you’re a straight up vegetable!
        
        …</p>
    <p>When you talk too much and think too much,

        It’s obvious to everyone you don’t know what you’re talking about.
        
        Just stop talking for once in your life and clear your head,
        
        You’ll figure shit out.
        
        …</p>
    <p>If you keep to the true core, you get the basic gist,

        But if you only go for appearances, you’re a total poser.
        
        If you know what it’s like to be cool inside yourself,
        
        Everything else that’s not that, is obviously fake, but still there.
        
        …</p>
    <p>All the wannabes and posers with their fake shit,

        Are only like that because they’re ignorant and clearly don’t get it.
        
        Trying to be cool is not cool. Trying to be real is not being real.
        
        …</p>
    <p>Be fierce about avoiding labels and not being a follower.

        If you try to be like someone else or something else,
        
        You’re just gonna suck because you’re trying to be something you’re not.
        
        …</p>
    <p>Things are all part of the big picture,

        But don’t get hooked on the big picture.
        
        When you’re cool with it and don’t think too much about it,
        
        Everything happens for a reason and it’s nobody’s fault.
        
        …</p>
    <p>If you don’t blame things for existing, then it’s sorta like they’re not even there.

        It’s not a thing. You’re cool with it. It is what it is. You don’t mind.
        
        When you see everything’s basically just some shit that doesn’t matter, your mind chills out.
        
        When your own mind says “peace out” and disappears, everything dips out.
        
        …</p>
    <p>You see stuff as a bunch of different things because your mind chunks it up.

        Your mind evolved to see stuff because there are a bunch of things to see.
        
        When you try to figure out what’s real and what’s your mind,
        
        You come up empty on understanding both your mind and all the stuff.
        
        …</p>
    <p>In that emptiness though, it’s all kind of the same.

        Everything you are and all you can see is all wrapped up in emptiness.
        
        If you see yourself as that emptiness and take the rough with the smooth,
        
        How can you even be for or against anything?
        
        …</p>
    <p>The millions of ways you can kick it in the Supreme Way are massive,

        It’s not just laid back and it’s not just a struggle.
        
        But if you’re smallminded or a square, you’re probably too chicken-shit to do it.
        
        Plus, the more you try to rush it, the longer it’s gonna take you.
        
        …</p>
    <p>If you’re hooked on being Mr. HotShitCoolDude, you’ll lose balance and turf it.

        You’ll start believing your own bullshit or get duped and thrown off.
        
        Just let go. You do you, and let everything else take its own course.
        
        There’s nowhere you need to bounce to, no one else you need to be. You got this!
        
        …</p>
    <p>Just be natural, because everything on Earth is natural.

        Flow with it freely and you’ll be in the zone.
        
        Don’t get hung up on some idea of how things should be (but aren’t).
        
        Don’t tune it all out and go dark either. You’ll get sunk!
        
        …</p>
    <p>It’s stupid to rage against the world. You just create your own headfuck.

        What’s the point of trying to line up all your likes and dislikes?
        
        You only live once!
        
        All your experiences, good or bad, are all part of life.
        
        …</p>
    <p>Experience, man! That’s what I’m talkin about!

        Feel it all! That’s the real deal!
        
        Someone wise to it wouldn’t try to change anything.
        
        Only a crazy dipshit would keep trying to do the same shit over and over.
        
        …</p>
    <p>There are no special things.

        “Special” is like, just your opinion, man!
        
        If you try to use your head to figure out what’s in your own head…
        
        Uh… DUH! Good luck with that… Ha ha!
        
        …</p>
    <p>If your head’s not on straight, you’ll be all “peace & love” one minute, and full-on aggro the next.

        When you finally see the light, you don’t need things to be any special way.
        
        When you always have opposites fighting against each other in your mind,
        
        You’re just making up problems in your head to drive yourself crazy
        
        …</p>
    <p>Hopes and dreams? Flowery imagined fantasies?

        Why do you only ever seem to want whatever it is you don’t have?
        
        Obsessing over getting things, or losing things; stressing over what’s right, or what’s wrong,
        
        Fuck it. Fuck all of it.
        
        …</p>
    <p>When you see shit for what it is, the eye never sleeps.

        No more living in a dream!
        
        If you stop with all the judgment and just let go,
        
        Everything is as it should be.
        
        …</p>
    <p>The universe is mysterious. It. Just. Is. Seriously, it’s OK.

        Did you honestly think you, me, or some Einstein would be the first person to finally figure it all out? Ha ha.
        
        Dude, don’t make me laugh my freakin’ ass off! We’re all just doing our best to get by.
        
        We all grew out of one nature, but act like we don’t know how to be natural. I guess we just forget, or are being stupid or something.
        
        …</p>
    <p>The whole shebang can’t be compared to some other thing because it’s all there is.

        If you need to take a rest, then you must have been busy.
        
        If you need to get busy, then you must have been resting.
        
        Pairs always go together. When you stop resting and stop being busy,
        
        What becomes of all that you do?
        
        …</p>
    <p>What’s real far out is, if you take this to the ultimate point,

        There are no more rules.
        
        When you get your mind on lock with this unity,
        
        All the made-up nonsense fades to black.
        
        No doubt.
        
        One love.
        
        …</p>
    <p>In the zone, there’s nothing left

        There’s nothing you have to remember.
        
        Clear like crystal, this vibe is always lit.
        
        Don’t strain your brain,
        
        Cuz this is when thinking is useless.
        
        It’s not knowledge. It’s a groove. You feel me?
        
        …</p>
    <p>This is the space of the really real.

        There is no you and there is nobody other than you.
        
        If you want to get there with a quickness,
        
        Just give a shout out to “Not Two!”
        
        …</p>
    <p>When there’s Not Two, we’re all one.

        It’s a party where everyone and everything is invited.
        
        Everyone truly cool, from any time or any place,
        
        Has had to figure this shit out.
        
        …</p>
    <p>This One truth can’t be any bigger or any smaller,

        Whether for just a second or a million years; it’s all the same difference.
        
        It’s not near or far, cuz there’s nowhere it is not.
        
        It’s like infinity stretched out before your eyes.
        
        …</p>
    <p>The microscopic stuff is as big as the infinitely huge stuff;

        Limits are just self-imposed. No limit.
        
        The infinitely huge stuff is just as small as the microscopic stuff;
        
        You can’t see beyond the border. No borders.
        
        …</p>
    <p>Whatever is, isn’t;

        Whatever isn’t, is.
        
        Until you get with that,
        
        You’re not altogether with it.
        
        …</p>
    <p>One for all;

        All for one.
        
        If you’re all in,
        
        You’ll never be without.
        
        …</p>
    <p>To trust in your heart-mind, is not about splitting in two.

        Not splitting in two, is about trusting in your heart-mind.
        
        It’s an unspoken thing.
        
        There are no words for the timeless. Let’s leave it at that.
        
        PEACE OUT BITCHES!</p>
