        <h3><u>Linji Teaches</u></h3>
        <h3>Surupamaerl</h3>
        <h3>10/16/2020</h3>
        <p><i>At the evening gathering the master addressed the assembly, saying:

            “Sometimes I take away the person but do not take away the surroundings; sometimes I take away the surroundings but do not take away the person; sometimes I take away both person and surroundings; sometimes I take away neither person nor surroundings.”
            
            </i></p>
        <p><i>Then a monk asked, “What about ‘to take away the person and not take away the surroundings’?”

            The master said:
            
            The spring sun comes forth, covering the earth with brocade;/A child’s hair hangs down, white as silken strands.</i></p>
        <p><i>The monk asked, “What about ‘to take away the surroundings and not take away the person’?”

            The master said:
            
            The rule of the sovereign prevails throughout the land;/The general has laid to rest the dusts of battle beyond the frontiers.</i></p>
        <p><i>Again the monk asked, “What about ‘to take away both person and surroundings’?”

            The master said:
            
            No news from Bing and Fen,/Isolated and away from everywhere.</i></p>
        <p><i>The monk asked, “What about ‘to take away neither person nor the surroundings’?”

            The master said:
            
            The sovereign ascends into the jeweled palace;/Aged rustics sing songs.</i></p>
        <br>
        <p>Going to the West, we find the Buddha-eye of the Indian Patriachs./Where is there dust, if no mirror?/Naturally moving, without concepts,/the world is a jewel.</p>
        <p>Going to the East, the body is perfected;/the mountain paths are chanced, the Pure Lands swept clean./What use is there polishing a tile into a mirror?/Removing distractions, liberation of will is achieved, and peace follows.</p>
        <p>Going to the North, we find the wooden blocks of silent illumination,/undisturbed by the possibility of reflection./Though war may threaten at the gates, how is one to see over a 1000 mile wall?/Rest reigns supreme, and all cares are dislodged.</p>
        <p>Following Deshan to the South, dust and jewels are found everywhere one turns./What extra thing can be discovered?/The Master finds their home, and the Layman makes a joke,/never asking for more.</p>
        <br>
        <p><b>With brutal clarity, Linji lays the entire thing at our feet:</b></p>
        <br>
        <p><i>Then the master said, “Nowadays, he who studies buddhadharma must seek true insight. Gaining true insight, he is not affected by birth-and-death, but freely goes or stays. He needn’t seek the excellent—that which is excellent will come of itself.

            “Followers of the Way, our eminent predecessors from of old have all had their ways of saving people. As for me, what I want to make clear to you is that you must not accept the deluded views of others. If you want to act, then act. Don’t hesitate.
            
            “Students today can’t get anywhere. What ails you? Lack of faith in yourself is what ails you. If you lack faith in yourself, you’ll keep on tumbling along, following in bewilderment aft er all kinds of circumstances and being taken by them through transformation after transformation without ever attaining freedom.
            
            “Bring to rest the thoughts of the ceaselessly seeking mind, and you will not differ from the patriarch-buddha. Do you want to know the patriarch-buddha? He is none other than you who stand before me listening to my discourse. But because you students lack faith in yourselves, you run around seeking something outside. Even if, through your seeking, you did find something, that something would be nothing more than fancy descriptions in written words; never would you gain the mind of the living patriarch. Make no mistake, worthy Chan men! If you don’t find it here and now, you’ll go on transmigrating through the three realms for myriads of kalpas and thousands of lives, and, held in the clutch of captivating circumstances, be born in the wombs of asses or cows."</i></p>

        <h3><u>Te Shan Carrying His Bundle</u></h3>
        <h3>Surupamaerl</h3>
        <h3>10/16/2020</h3>
        <h4>Blue Cliff Record: Case IV</h4>
        <p><i>When Te Shan arrived at Kuei Shan, he carried his bundle with him into the teaching hall, where he crossed from east to west and from west to east. He looked around and said, "There's nothing, no one." Then he went out.

            Hsueh Tou added the comment, "Completely exposed." But when Te Shan got to the monastery gate, he said, "Still, I shouldn't be so coarse." So he reentered (the hall) with full ceremony to meet (Kuei Shan). As Kuei Shan sat there, Te Shan held up his sitting mat and said, "Teacher!" Kuei Shan reached for his whisk, whereupon Te Shan shouted, shook out his sleeves, and left.
            
            Hsueh Tou added the comment, "Completely exposed."
            
            Te Shan turned his back on the teaching hall, put on his straw sandals, and departed. That evening Kuei Shan asked the head monk, "Where is that newcomer who just came?" The head monk answered, "At that time he turned his back on the teaching hall, put on his straw sandals, and departed."
            
            Kuei Shan said, "Hereafter that lad will go to the summit of a solitary peak, build himself a grass hut, and go on scolding the Buddhas and reviling the Patriarchs."
            
            Hsueh Tou added the comment, "He adds frost to snow."</i></p>
        <br>
        <p>Teshan knows how to look like a fool while being a complete badass. Yuanwu calls them "the board-carrying fellow [someone whose vision being obstructed by the burden], the wild fox spirit! [someone who guilty of being clever]" Teshan walks in, walks around in some symbolic way, and says, "There's nothing, no one" and leaves. Yuanwu comments:</p>
        <br>
        <p><i>He deserves thirty blows of the staff. Indeed his spirit reaches the heavens. A real lion cub can roar the lion's roar.</i></p>
        <br>
        <p>But Yuanwu also says:</p>
        <br>
        <p><i>Wasn't he crazy?...See how extraordinary that Te Shan was; this is why it is said, "To stand out from the crowd, you must be a brave spirited fellow; to defeat enemies is a matter for a lion's son. If you try to become Buddha without an eye like this, how will you ever do it, even in a thousand years?"</i></p>
        <br>
        <p>What are we to make of this foolish courage?</p>
        <p>Yuanwu comments on the Kuei Shan:</p>
        <br>
        <p><i>This old fellow Kuei Shan still was not taken in by that (Te Shan) anyone but Kuei Shan would have been crushed by him. Look at how the old adept Kuei Shan meets him; he just sits there and observes the outcome. If he did not profoundly discern the 'oncoming wind,' how could he have been like this?</i></p>
        <br>
        <p>The old man is settled and steady. Afterwards, Teshan thinks to reform his idiotic behaviour, and challenges Kuei Shan to be his teacher, and Kuei Shan accepts! Bluff called, Teshan is exposed for a foolish lion cub, and Kuei Shan is exposed for an old bear. Teshan runs out of there, shaking their sleeves and shouting like a Zen Master and thinking they are being clever. Yuanwu calls them outstanding.</p>
        <br>
        <p><i>Kuei Shan was not flustered at all. This is why it is said, "One whose wisdom surpasses a bird's can catch a bird, one whose wisdom surpasses an animal's can catch an animal, and one whose wisdom surpasses a man's can catch a man." When one is immersed in this kind of Ch'an, even if the multitude of appearances and myriad forms, heavens and hells, and all the plants, animals, and people, all were to shout at once, he still wouldn't be bothered; even if someone overthrew his meditation seat and scattered his congregation with shouts, he wouldn't give it any notice.</i></p>
        <br>
        <p>Every Xuedou's "Completely exposed" is met with Yuanwu's "Wrong. After all. Check!" Yuanwu wants us to see what they see; an idiot pretending to be a Zen Master, but also firebrand with the courage to pull down golden Buddha's from where they sit and shatter them across the grass. This is why their comment on Teshan's decision to go out and destroy the Zen devils in the south is "You see from how aroused he got, what a fierce, keen fellow he was."</p>
        <p>"He adds frost to snow" can now be taken in two ways. Do you see?</p>
        <br>
        <h4>Verse</h4>
        <p><i>One "completely exposed"/"Adding frost to snow" -(Te Shan) has had a dangerous fall./The General of the Flying Cavalry enters the enemy camp;/How many could regain their safety?/(Te Shan) hurriedly runs past-/(But Kuei Shan) doesn't let him go./On the summit of the solitary peak, he sits among the weeds;/Bah!</i></p>
        <br>
        <p>Yuanwu says "It is easy to distinguish dragons from snakes; it is hard to fool a patchrobed monk." I am going to let them speak at length because it is truly outstanding.</p>
        <p>The first three lines refer to famous Archer who was boldly captured, and boldly escaped. Yuanwu explains:</p>
        <br>
        <p><i>This fellow had the ability to wrest life from the midst of death; Hsueh Tou alludes to this in the verse to make a comparison with Te Shan, who re-entered (the teaching hall) to meet (Kuei Shan), and was able to leap out again, as before.

            Look at how that Ancient (Te Shan) sees all the way, speaks all the way, acts all the way, and functions all the way; he's undeniably a brave spirit. Only if you possess the ability to kill a man without blinking an eye can you then become Buddha right where you stand. Someone who can fulfill Buddhahood right where he stands naturally kills people without blinking an eye; thus he has his share of freedom and independence.</i></p>
        <br>
        <p>I see this in myself and am afraid; of what I might lose; of the damage I might cause. Teshan is braver than I. At least I am not wild fox spirit.</p>
        <br>
        <p><i>When some people these days are questioned, at first they seem to have the qualities of a patchrobed monk, but when they're pressed even slightly, their waists snap and their legs break; they come all to pieces. They totally lack the slightest continuity. That is why an Ancient said, "Continuity is indeed very difficult." Look at how Te Shan and Kuei Shan acted; were theirs stammering, halting views?</i></p>
        <br>
        <p>This I find easier to practice. Still a work in progress, but less concepts to cut up. I've heard of ZMs having continuity for decades.</p>
        <br>
        <p><i>At this point, why does Hsueh Tau say, "On the summit of the solitary peak, he sits among the weeds," and then add an exclamation? Tell me, what does this come down to? Study for thirty more years!</i></p>
        <br>
        <p>"He adds frost to snow" can now be taken in two ways. Do you see?! Speak! If you can't, you're already dead!</p>

        <h3><u>TRUST IN HEART-MIND (Jungle_Toad Remix)</u></h3>
        <h3>Jungle Toad</h3>
        <h3>8/22/2020</h3>
        <h4>Introduction:</h4>
        <p>So, I decided to do my own interpretation of the 3rd Patriarch's (Seng Ts'an's) famous poem, the Hsin Hsin Ming (aka Faith in Mind Inscription, aka Trust in Heart-Mind, aka Song of Enlightenment, etc.). My version is written to sound like a surfer dude. Why did I do this? I don't know. I thought it would be funny, and I thought it would be a good exercise for myself to study the various versions of the poem and try to put the phrases in everyday language, so I could better understand it. Because discussions about zen are inherently contradictory and confusing, it is naturally esoteric. Nevertheless, it is fundamentally not meant to be elitist. This is one of the things I love about zen. It's for everyone, even if not everyone understands it. I had that in mind while working on this project. I hope you have fun with it, as I did in making it.</p>
        <p>There are many translations available out there. I based my remix largely on Blyth's, Cleary's, Waley's, and Wonderwheel's. I had a bunch of tabs open while trying to figure out how to phrase each line.</p>
        <p><i>Original poem (Hsin Hsin Ming) by Seng Ts’an, the 3rd Zen Patriarch</i></p>
        <h4>Jungle Toad Remix:</h4>
        <p>The Supreme Way is like not even hard.

            Just stop being a fussmuppet, wanting everything your own way.
            
            Don’t obsess about shit. Don’t hate shit.
            
            Then you’ll start to grok it.
            
            …</p>
        <p>If you’re like a smidge off though… Dayumn!

            Bruh, you get totally pitted!
            
            If you’re gonna surf that shit right, homie,
            
            Just don’t be anti all the time… but like, don’t be a fanboy/fangirl either
            
            …</p>
        <p>Bitching about what you want and what you don’t,

            That’s just stupid ass head games you play in your own mind.
            
            If you keep pushing to figure out what’s up,
            
            Then there’s no point in even trying to get yourself to be chill.
            
            …</p>
        <p>When you really know what’s up, it’s like this cosmic space thing.

            You don’t need stuff because you already have all you need.
            
            For reals! It’s only cuz you’re like “Yay! I want this!” or “Wah! I don’t like that!”,
            
            That you don’t see what I’m talking about.
            
            …</p>
        <p>Don’t try to force the vibes to happen,

            But don’t just zone out like some crackhead either.
            
            Just be mellow and don’t worry too much about it.
            
            It’s cool. Shit just kind of sorts itself out
            
            …</p>
        <p>When you hit the brakes and come to full stop,

            Then you’re “driving” by idling.
            
            If you only use the gas pedal or only use the brakes,
            
            Then you don’t know what you’re doing behind the wheel, dufus! Ha ha!
            
            …</p>
        <p>All this shit goes together.

            If you’re all about just doing shit, or just not doing shit: Epic fail!
            
            If you try to bail on everything, then you’re not keepin it real either.
            
            If you’re too open minded,
            
            Your brain falls out and you’re a straight up vegetable!
            
            …</p>
        <p>When you talk too much and think too much,

            It’s obvious to everyone you don’t know what you’re talking about.
            
            Just stop talking for once in your life and clear your head,
            
            You’ll figure shit out.
            
            …</p>
        <p>If you keep to the true core, you get the basic gist,

            But if you only go for appearances, you’re a total poser.
            
            If you know what it’s like to be cool inside yourself,
            
            Everything else that’s not that, is obviously fake, but still there.
            
            …</p>
        <p>All the wannabes and posers with their fake shit,

            Are only like that because they’re ignorant and clearly don’t get it.
            
            Trying to be cool is not cool. Trying to be real is not being real.
            
            …</p>
        <p>Be fierce about avoiding labels and not being a follower.

            If you try to be like someone else or something else,
            
            You’re just gonna suck because you’re trying to be something you’re not.
            
            …</p>
        <p>Things are all part of the big picture,

            But don’t get hooked on the big picture.
            
            When you’re cool with it and don’t think too much about it,
            
            Everything happens for a reason and it’s nobody’s fault.
            
            …</p>
        <p>If you don’t blame things for existing, then it’s sorta like they’re not even there.

            It’s not a thing. You’re cool with it. It is what it is. You don’t mind.
            
            When you see everything’s basically just some shit that doesn’t matter, your mind chills out.
            
            When your own mind says “peace out” and disappears, everything dips out.
            
            …</p>
        <p>You see stuff as a bunch of different things because your mind chunks it up.

            Your mind evolved to see stuff because there are a bunch of things to see.
            
            When you try to figure out what’s real and what’s your mind,
            
            You come up empty on understanding both your mind and all the stuff.
            
            …</p>
        <p>In that emptiness though, it’s all kind of the same.

            Everything you are and all you can see is all wrapped up in emptiness.
            
            If you see yourself as that emptiness and take the rough with the smooth,
            
            How can you even be for or against anything?
            
            …</p>
        <p>The millions of ways you can kick it in the Supreme Way are massive,

            It’s not just laid back and it’s not just a struggle.
            
            But if you’re smallminded or a square, you’re probably too chicken-shit to do it.
            
            Plus, the more you try to rush it, the longer it’s gonna take you.
            
            …</p>
        <p>If you’re hooked on being Mr. HotShitCoolDude, you’ll lose balance and turf it.

            You’ll start believing your own bullshit or get duped and thrown off.
            
            Just let go. You do you, and let everything else take its own course.
            
            There’s nowhere you need to bounce to, no one else you need to be. You got this!
            
            …</p>
        <p>Just be natural, because everything on Earth is natural.

            Flow with it freely and you’ll be in the zone.
            
            Don’t get hung up on some idea of how things should be (but aren’t).
            
            Don’t tune it all out and go dark either. You’ll get sunk!
            
            …</p>
        <p>It’s stupid to rage against the world. You just create your own headfuck.

            What’s the point of trying to line up all your likes and dislikes?
            
            You only live once!
            
            All your experiences, good or bad, are all part of life.
            
            …</p>
        <p>Experience, man! That’s what I’m talkin about!

            Feel it all! That’s the real deal!
            
            Someone wise to it wouldn’t try to change anything.
            
            Only a crazy dipshit would keep trying to do the same shit over and over.
            
            …</p>
        <p>There are no special things.

            “Special” is like, just your opinion, man!
            
            If you try to use your head to figure out what’s in your own head…
            
            Uh… DUH! Good luck with that… Ha ha!
            
            …</p>
        <p>If your head’s not on straight, you’ll be all “peace & love” one minute, and full-on aggro the next.

            When you finally see the light, you don’t need things to be any special way.
            
            When you always have opposites fighting against each other in your mind,
            
            You’re just making up problems in your head to drive yourself crazy
            
            …</p>
        <p>Hopes and dreams? Flowery imagined fantasies?

            Why do you only ever seem to want whatever it is you don’t have?
            
            Obsessing over getting things, or losing things; stressing over what’s right, or what’s wrong,

            Dude, don’t make me laugh my freakin’ ass off! We’re all just doing our best to get by.
            
            We all grew out of one nature, but act like we don’t know how to be natural. I guess we just forget, or are being stupid or something.

            If you need to get busy, then you must have been resting.

            Clear like crystal, this vibe is always lit.
            
            Don’t strain your brain,
            
            Cuz this is when thinking is useless.

        <p>This is the space of the really real.

            There is no you and there is nobody other than you.
            
            If you want to get there with a quickness,
            
            Just give a shout out to “Not Two!”

            Whether for just a second or a million years; it’s all the same difference.
            
            It’s not near or far, cuz there’s nowhere it is not.

            Limits are just self-imposed. No limit.
            
            The infinitely huge stuff is just as small as the microscopic stuff;

            Whatever isn’t, is.
            
            Until you get with that,
            
            You’re not altogether with it.

        <p>To trust in your heart-mind, is not about splitting in two.

            Not splitting in two, is about trusting in your heart-mind.

        <p><i>Someone asked Yunmen, “What is the essence of a patch-robed monk?”

            The Master said, “It’s your turn!”
            
            The questioner insisted, “Please, Master, tell me!”
            
            The Master said, “I’m playing the harp for an ox!”</i></p>
        <p>.....</p>
        <p>Is it your turn to sing in the round yet?

            Yunmen answered the question the first time it was asked, but the monk is not in accord with the tune, so he misses the beautiful melody. But how can he get in accord with the music of his very own essence? Can anyone play him a song that will open his ears to his own heart?
            
            .....</p>

        <p><i>A long time ago in China there were two friends, one who played the harp skillfully and one who listened skillfully.

            When the one played or sang about a mountain, the other would say: ‘I can see the mountain before us.’ When the one played about water, the listener would exclaim: ‘Here is the running stream!’
            
            But the listener fell sick and died. The first friend cut the strings of his harp and never played again. Since that time the cutting of harp strings has always been a sign of intimate friendship.</i></p>

        <h3><u>Metacommunication with Bodhidharma and playing Rock Paper Scissors with the Zen Masters.</u></h3>
        <h3>Jungle Toad</h3>
        <h3>7/28/2020</h3>
        <p>“I always lie” or stated for better logical formalism “This statement is a lie.” This is the classic Liar’s Paradox, also called the Epimenides Paradox because Epimenides, a Cretan, famously said “All Cretans are liars!” If the statement is true, then it must be a lie, but if it’s false, then it must be true. How does one resolve it? There are multiple philosophical arguments for how to resolve the paradox, but the one I want to discuss is ‘metacommunication’ because I think it is helpful in understanding zen masters.</p>
        <br>
        <p>If you think of the phrase “This statement is a lie” as a metacommunication (a communication about a communication) then you can make some sense of the statement. If everything I say actually is a lie, then there still has to be the possibility for truth, I just don’t speak it. So, if I shift the conversation to the higher meta level, then I can transcend the truths and lies by simply making a metastatement that “I always lie” and then that can be true about all my non-meta communications. It’s sort of a “free pass” because it comes from a transcended level where truth and lies are both always possible and not possible (empty), even if, in the particular communications, they are always lies.</p>
        <br>
        <p><b>What does this have to do with Bodhidharma and Zen?</b></p>
        <br>
        <p>From Bodhidharma onward, the zen masters commonly make jumps to transcended meta-levels and it can be difficult to understand them if you don’t realize they are doing this. Let’s look at some examples of this. First, let’s take the Mahayana (‘great vehicle’ or ‘great raft’) Buddhist metaphor of enlightenment being like “going to the other shore.” Bodhidharma crosses the other shore by leaving both shores for the meta-level.</p>
        <br>
        <p><i>“When you're deluded, this shore exists. When you wake up, it doesn't exist. Mortals stay on this shore. But those who discover the greatest of all vehicles stay on neither this shore nor the other shore. They're able to leave both shores. Those who see the other shore as different from this shore don't understand zen.”</i></p>
        <p>-from Bodhidharma’s Wake-Up Sermon</p>
        <br>
        <p>So you see, mortals can’t cross the other shore because they are deluded in believing that there is another shore in the first place and that they don’t have access to. But “the greatest vehicle” leads you to abide in neither shore, similar to how the meta explanation for the Epimenides Paradox allows a metacommunication outside of ‘truth or lie’ to communicate about the ordinary communications of Cretans, all of which are lies.</p>
        <br>
        <p>And when Bodhidharma speaks of this “greatest vehicle” he collapses the Three Vehicles of Buddhism (Mahayana, Hinayana, Tantrayana) into One Greatest Vehicle: Mind. He explicitly states this elsewhere and reminds us that the sutras say that “No vehicle is the vehicle of the Buddhas”, but I think he most clearly explains it in the following paragraph:</p>
        <br>
        <p><i>“Whoever knows that the mind is a fiction and devoid of anything real knows that his own mind neither exists nor doesn't exist. Mortals keep creating the mind, claiming it exists. And arhats keep negating the mind, claiming it doesn't exist. But bodhisattvas and buddhas neither create nor negate the mind. This is what's meant by the mind that neither exists nor doesn't exist. The mind that neither exists nor doesn't exist is called the Middle Way.”</i></p>
        <p>-from Bodhidharma’s ‘Wake Up Sermon’</p>
        <br>
        <p>Again, at the meta-level there is ‘mind’ and ‘no mind’, there is ‘buddha’ and ‘no buddha’. You can’t seek mind with mind, because mind needs to classify, condense, and encode. Mind cannot condense and encode itself, and so classification no longer makes sense other than in considering all that one is doing (and not doing) as Mind. Yet, there is this really fascinating dialectic here between realism and solipsism/nihilism. Everything you have ever experienced in your life has all been experienced in your mind. You’ve never experienced anything real (or fake) because it has all been condensed information encoded into your senses or your thoughts. None of it is reality. And yet, the only real thing you know without question is that you are consciously experiencing the world. You only experience reality inside the brain inside your skull, yet that consciousness inside your brain and skull exists in reality. They fold in on each other. This is the Middle Way, as Bodhidharma is explaining it. It’s not about balancing between this and that. It is residing right there in that zone where the real and illusory are all the same source, which is everywhere (and nowhere)</p>
        <br>
        <p>Now that we have discussed the dialectic between realism and solipsism/nihilism, and the meta level of this view of the Middle Way, I want to discuss what I call playing Rock, Paper, Scissors with the zen masters. This is currently a hypothesis I am playing with, so take it with a huge grain of salt, but many Buddhist terms come in threes, which I will call tri-concepts which I think guide a lot of zen conversational maneuvers. Many of the threes connect point-by-point to other threes. As a refresher, here are some of the main Buddhist tri-concepts (I have included in parentheses next to each tri-concept how I think it relates to the other tri-concepts).</p>
        <br>
        <p><b>Three Realms:</b>Desire Realm, Form Realm, Formless Realm</p>
        <br>
        <p><b>Three Poisons:</b>(generated in the three realms): Greed, Anger, Delusion</p>
        <br>
        <p><b>Threefold Way:</b>(ways out of the three poisons): Morality, Meditation, Wisdom (this is a condensed version of the eightfold path, which Bodhidharam mentions only very briefly in the Bloodstream Sermon)</p>
        <br>
        <p><b>Three Vehicles:</b>Three Vehicles (to travel out of the three realms): Tantrayana, Hinayana, Mahayana</p>
        <br>
        <p><b>Three Buddha Bodies:</b>(are arrived at by the three vehicles): dharmakaya (reality body or truth body), sambhogakaya (bliss body or reward body), nirmanakaya (emanation body or physical body)</p>
        <br>
        <p>Here is a quote from Bodhidharma linking the Three Poisons to the Three Realms:</p>
        <br>
        <p><i>“An uninhabited place is one without greed, anger, or delusion. Greed is the realm of desire, anger the realm of form, and delusion the formless realm. When a thought begins, you enter the three realms. When a thought ends, you leave the three realms.”</i></p>
        <p>-from Bodhidharma’s ‘Wake Up Sermon’</p>
        <br>
        <p>Notice he distinguishes the 3 realms, distinguishes the 3 poisons, associates the 3 realms with the 3 poisons, and also leaves them all when a thought ends. Red Pine’s footnotes explain that “an uninhabited place” is a place where one becomes enlightened, and is sometimes used to refer to a zen monastery (though presumably it could be anywhere). In this way, it’s similar to the meta-level I discussed earlier; beyond the threes. I think zen masters will sometimes illicit the tri-concepts while trying to push you beyond the tri-concepts, and they do so in a sort-of Rock/Paper/Scissors fashion where if you communicate that you are too attached to the form realm, they highlight something spiritual you desire from the desire realm; or they communicate about the formless to shock and surprise you away from forms. If you become too detached in the formless realm, they hit you with some emotionally evocative poetry from the realm of desire; or smack you with a staff to whack you back to the realm of form. If you communicate that you are suffering while being awash with emotional cravings and desires, they demonstrate that the most sublime is found in the concrete and ordinary from the realm of form (like Buddha is 3 pounds of flax); or they lead you to the formless realm where everything is neither good or bad. All of this is not just to shove you around the 3 realms though, because you need to hit the meta-level as well. Mind beats form, formless, and desire realms.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Yuanwu sometimes speaks of “In raising one, he illuminates three; In raising three, he illuminates one.” I visualize this as raising the corner of a sheet of paper. The meta-level is the whole paper, but if you raise the paper by a corner, you see the other 3 corners. Enough of this and you start to recognize the whole paper from the relationship of the corners, then realize they are all of one piece, though the corners can be differentiated. Yuanwu (and other zen masters) also use lots of other related phrases like folding out and folding in, or rolling out and rolling in, knowing where it will land after it has been brought up. This all seems to me, to in some way be relating the particulars to the universal, and vice verse. By condensing the varied tangible world into the one primal source, you can travel easily (in one vehicle: Mind) between the tangible and the source.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Yunmen is particularly adept at playing the rock, paper, scissors game. Take this passage from Yuanwu, who describes how Yunmen plays the game:</p>
        <br>
        <p><i>“You must understand how Yun Men raises one and illuminates three, raises three and illuminates one. If you go to his three phrases to seek, then you're pulling an arrow out of the back of your head. In a single phrase of Yun Men's, three phrases are inevitably present: the phrase that contains heaven and earth, the phrase that follows the waves and pursues the currents, and the phrase that cuts off the myriad streams. (What he says) is naturally exactly appropriate. But tell me, of the three phrases, which one does Yun Men use to receive people?”</i></p>
        <p>-Yuanwu in commentary to Blue Cliff Record: Case #27 ‘Yun Men’s Body Exposed, The Golden Wind’</p>
        <br>
        <p>In my view, “the phrase that contains heaven and earth” relates to the realm of desire, “the phrase that follows the waves and pursues the currents” relates to the realm of form, and “the phrase that cuts off the myriad streams” relates to the realm of the formless… however, I do recognize that I am putting square Buddhist pegs into round Zen holes here. I think you should take the words as they are because Zen masters are operating from that transcended meta-level, where any of the constituent parts need to be understood differently as existing only in Mind/No Mind, thus still being somewhat illusory, yet translatable to the real world. Yunmen never loses site of any of this, and is very adept at allowing the contradictions to co-exist without losing the ability to discern them. Notice, however, when you read koans how readily you can see zen masters confronting one corner of a tri-concept with another, while not forgetting the big picture. I think it will aid in your study. Yunmen spells it out for us:</p>
        <br>
        <p><i>The Master one day held up his staff and mentioned a teaching that goes:

            The ordinary person in all sincerity says that this [staff] exists, [representatives of] the two vehicles of Buddhist teaching explain that it doesn't exist, the pratyeka buddhas say it exists as an illusion, and the bodhisattvas empty it as it is.
            
            Then Master Yunmen said, "When a patch-robed monk sees this staff, he just calls it a staff; when he walks, he just walks; and when he sits, he just sits. In all of this he cannot be stirred."</i></p>
        <p>-from Zen Master Yunmen, translated by Urs App</p>
        <br>
        <p>To understand all of this intellectually, as I am trying to do in this post, is ultimately a losing game. The One-Mind is only understood tacitly beyond the written word. Just remember that I started this long-winded post with the phrase “I always lie.”</p>
        <br>
        <p>One last case to end on as I contemplate the meaning of 3x3 sets:</p>
        <br>
        <p><i>Manjusri asked Wu Cho, "Where have you just come from?" Wu Cho said, "The South." Manjusri said, "How is the Buddhist Teaching being carried on in the South?" Wu Cho said, "Monks of the Last Age have little regard for the rules of discipline." Manjusri said, "How numerous are the congregations?" Wu Cho said, "Some three hundred, some five hundred." Wu Cho asked Manjusri, "How is it being carried on hereabouts?" Manjusri said, "Ordinary people and sages dwell together; dragons and snakes intermingle." Wu Cho said, "How numerous are the congregations?" Manjusri said, "In front, three by three; in back, three by three."</i></p>

        <br>
        <p><i>When objects appear they cannot turn you around. Though the uninterrupted hellish karma of the habit energy of your past is still there, it spontaneously becomes the great ocean of liberation.</i></p>
        <br>
        <p><i>These days students in general do not know the Dharma. They are like goats: whatever they encounter, they put in their mouths. They do not distinguish between the slaves and the free, the guests and the host.</i></p>
        <br>

        <br>
        <p><i>As for "leavers of home", they must be able to perceive with true understanding in ordinary life.</i></p>

        <p><i>Right now there’s something where enlightenment and delusion share the same substance undivided.</i></p>

        <br>
        <p><i>Linji said: A moment when your mind is in doubt is delusion.

        <h3><u>[Linji] [Puhua] Puhua Rings His Little Bell</u></h3>
        <h3>Green Sage</h3>
        <h3>4/25/2020</h3>
        <p><i>(From the Recorded Sayings of Linji; Combination of translations by R. Sasaki and T. Cleary)</i></p>
        <br>
        <p><i>One day Linji was sitting with [two monks named] Heyang and Muta by the stove in the monks’ hall. They were talking about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puhua">[Puhua]</a>, who was in the marketplace every day capering around acting crazy, and wondering whether he was an ordinary man or a sage.</i></p>
        <br>
        <p><i>Before their talk finished, Puhua happened to come in, so Linji asked him, "Are you an ordinary man or a sage?"</i></p>
        <br>
        <p><i>Puhua said, "You tell me, am I an ordinary man or a sage?"</i></p>
        <br>
        <p><i>Linji then shouted.</i></p>
        <br>
        <p><i>Puhua pointed to them and said, "Heyang is a new bride, Muta is an old lady! Linji is a little pisser, but he has the eye!"</i></p>
        <br>
        <p><i>Linji exclaimed, "You thief!"</i></p>
        <br>
        <p><i>Puhua cried, "Thief! Thief!" and went out.</i></p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p><i>One day Puhua was in front of the monks' hall, eating some raw vegetables.</i></p>
        <br>
        <p><i>Linji saw him and said, "Just like a donkey."</i></p>
        <br>
        <p><i>"Heehaw, heehaw!" brayed Puhua.</i></p>
        <br>
        <p><i>Linji said, "You thief!"</i></p>
        <br>
        <p><i>Puhua cried, "Thief! Thief!" and went out.
        </i></p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p><i>Every day in the marketplace Puhua would ring a small bell and say,</i></p>
        <br>
        <p><i>"If you come in light, I hit you in light."</i></p>
        <br>
        <p><i>"If you come in darkness, I hit you in darkness."</i></p>
        <br>
        <p><i>"If you come from the four quarters and eight directions, I hit you like a whirlwind."</i></p>
        <br>
        <p><i>"If you come from emptiness, I lash you like a flail."</i></p>
        <br>
        <p><i>Linji sent his attendant [with instructions] to hold Puhua fast as soon as he saw him talk like this and say, "If I don't come in any of these ways, then what?"</i></p>
        <br>
        <p><i>[When the attendant did this] Puhua pushed him away and said, "Tomorrow there’s a feast at Dabei Yuan; the Temple of Great Compassion."</i></p>
        <br>
        <p><i>The attendant returned and related this to Linji.</i></p>
        <br>
        <p><i>Linji said, "I’ve always doubted this guy."</i></p>

        <br>
        <p><i>These days there are many public teachers whose guiding eye is not clear. How wrong this is!</i></p>
        <br>
        <p><i>How dare they mount a pulpit to try to help others?!</i></p>
        <br>
        <p><i>Showing a symbol of authority, they rant and rave at people without any qualms, simply pursuing the immediate and not worrying about the future.</i></p>
        <br>
        <p><i>How miserable!
        </i></p>
        <br>
        <p><i>If you have any kind of a clue at all, you should not let yourself be set up as a teacher as long as you are not enlightened, because to do so is an absolute travesty!</i></p>
        <br>
        <p><i>If there is something real in you, "musk is naturally fragrant" they say.</i></p>
        <br>
        <p><i>Do you understand this?</i></p>
        <br>
        <h3><i>Just look how many phony "Zen Masters" there are, degenerating away each and every day. They are like human feces carved into wooden icons; in the end, all you're left with is the smell of shit!</i></h3>
        <br>
        <p><i>Wishing to get out of birth and death, wishing to attain release, you try to become unified; but one does not attain unification after becoming homogenized. If you try to make yourself unified, you will certainly not attain unification.</i></p>
        <br>
        <p><i>There's a story about a seeker who called on a Wayfarer and asked, as they roamed the mountains, "An ancient teacher said he sought unification for thirty years without being able to attain it; what does this mean?"</i></p>
        <br>
        <p><i>The Wayfarer replied, "I too am thus."</i></p>
        <br>
        <p><i>Then he asked the seeker, "Understand?"</i></p>
        <br>
        <p><i>He also gave the seeker a poem:</i></p>
        <br>
        <p><i><b>The ancient teacher attains unification</b></i></p>
        <p><i><b>And I too am thus;</b></i></p>
        <p><i><b>Before the end of this month,</b></i></p>
        <p><i><b>I will settle it for you again.</b></i></p>
        <br>
        <p><i>At the end of the month, the Wayfarer passed away.</i></p>
        <br>
        <p><i>Tell me about unification; is it good or bad?</i></p>
        <br>
        <p><i>The ancient teacher attained unification, and I too am thus.</i></p>

        <p><i>(Foyan, T. Cleary translation, Instant Zen ("Independence"))</i></p>
        <br>
        <p><i>What do you people come to me for?</i></p>
        <br>
        <p><i>Each individual should lead life autonomously—don’t listen to what other people say.</i></p>
        <br>
        <p><i>An ancient declared, “I knew how to lead life by the time I was eighteen.”</i></p>
        <br>
        <p><i>You people must learn to live independently.</i></p>
        <br>
        <p><i>You say, “Lead what life?”</i></p>
        <br>
        <p><i>Just do not seek elsewhere.</i></p>
        <br>
        <p><i>Most people today are compulsively active; this is already not knowing how to lead life. This is called abandoning home, scattering the family, and becoming a drifter. Clearly this is not understanding.</i></p>
        <br>
        <p><i>Just searching and seeking, studying a bit of intellectual knowledge, memorizing a few sayings, is called “hauling manure inside.”</i></p>
        <br>
        <p><i>When you get here, your actions have to be truly accurate; eventually it will sink in thoroughly, and then you will understand.</i></p>
        <br>
        <h3><i>An ancient said, “Everywhere is you. Go east, and it’s you; go west, and it’s you. Who are you?”</i></h3>
        <br>
        <p><i>If you say, “Me,” this is emotional and intellectual consciousness, which you must pass through before you attain realization.</i></p>
        <br>
        <p><i>In ancient times Vasubandhu asked Asanga, “Elder brother, when you went to the inner palace, what teaching did Maitreya expound to you?”</i></p>
        <br>
        <p><i>Asanga replied, “He expounded this teaching.”</i></p>
        <br>
        <p><i>Now tell me, what teaching is this?</i></p>
        <br>
        <p><i>You must be able to discern it before you can realize it.</i></p>
        <br>
        <p><i>Don’t fix recognition on "this". Many people have been fooled by the term "this".</i></p>
        <br>
        <p><i>That is why they speak of illness as if it were medicine.</i></p>
        <br>
        <p><i>Therefore we say they are pitiful.</i></p>

        <h3>Green Sage</h3>
        <h3>4/19/2020</h3>
        <p>This OP is intended for anyone wondering what Buddhist scriptures, sutras, chanting, mediation, and other various practices have to do with Zen and what the Zen Masters (or at least, Huangbo but ... well that's another conversation) had to say about the whole thing.</p>
        <br>
        <h3>HuangBo</h3>
        <br>
        <p><i>(J. Blofeld translaton)</i></p>
        <br>
        <p><i><b>As to performing the six pāramitās and vast numbers of similar practices, or gaining merits as countless as the sands of the Ganges, since you are fundamentally complete in every respect, you should not try to supplement that perfection by such meaningless practices.</b> When there is occasion for them, perform them; and, when the occasion is passed, remain quiescent.</i></p>
        <br>
        <p><i><b>If you are not absolutely convinced that the Mind is the Buddha, and if you are attached to forms, practices and meritorious performances, your way of thinking is false and quite incompatible with the Way.</b></i></p>
        <br>
        <p><i>The Mind is the Buddha, nor are there any other Buddhas or any other mind. It is bright and spotless as the void, having no form or appearance whatever.</i></p>
        <br>
        <p><i>To make use of your minds to think conceptually is to leave the substance and attach yourselves to form. The Ever-Existent Buddha is not a Buddha of form or attachment.</i></p>
        <br>
        <p><i><b>To practice the six pāramitās and a myriad similar practices with the intention of becoming a Buddha thereby is to advance by stages, but the Ever-Existent Buddha is not a Buddha of stages.</b></i></p>
        <br>
        <p><i>Only awake to the One Mind, and <b>there is nothing whatsoever to be attained.</b> This is the real Buddha.</i></p>
        <br>
        <p><i>The Buddha and all sentient beings are the One Mind and nothing else.</i></p>
        <br>
        <p><i>Mind is like the void in which there is no confusion or evil; as when the sun wheels through [the emptiness of the sky] shining upon the four corners of the world. For, when the sun rises and illuminates the whole earth, the void gains not in brilliance; and, when the sun sets, the void does not darken.</i></p>
        <br>
        <p><i>The phenomena of light and dark alternate with each other, but the nature of the void remains unchanged. So it is with the Mind of the Buddha and of sentient beings.
        </i></p>
        <br>
        <p><i><b>If you look upon the Buddha as presenting a pure, bright or Enlightened appearance, or upon sentient beings as presenting a foul, dark or mortal-seeming appearance, these conceptions resulting from attachment to form will keep you from supreme knowledge, even after the passing of as many aeons as there are sands in the Ganges.</b></i></p>
        <br>
        <p><i>There is only the One Mind and not a particle of anything else on which to lay hold, for this Mind is the Buddha.</i></p>
        <br>
        <p><i><b>If you students of the Way do not awake to this Mind substance, you will overlay Mind with conceptual thought, you will seek the Buddha outside yourselves, and you will remain attached to forms, pious practices and so on, all of which are harmful and not at all the way to supreme knowledge.</b></i></p>
        <br>
        <p><i><b>This Mind is no mind of conceptual thought</b> and it is completely detached from form.</i></p>
        <br>
        <p><i>So Buddhas and sentient beings do not differ at all. If you can only rid yourselves of conceptual thought, you will have accomplished everything.</i></p>
        <br>
        <p><i>But if you students of the Way do not rid yourselves of conceptual thought in a flash, even though you strive for aeon after aeon, you will never accomplish it.</i></p>
        <br>
        <p><i><b>Enmeshed in the meritorious practices of the Three Vehicles, you will be unable to attain Enlightenment.</b></i></p>
        <br>
        <p><i><b>When the people of the world hear it said that the Buddhas transmit the Doctrine of the Mind, they suppose that there is something to be attained or realized apart from Mind, and thereupon they use Mind to seek the Dharma, not knowing that Mind and the object of their search are one.</b></i></p>
        <br>
        <p><i>Mind cannot be used to seek something from Mind; for then, after the passing of millions of aeons, the day of success will still not have dawned. <b>Such a method is not to be compared with suddenly eliminating conceptual thought, which is the fundamental Dharma.</b></i></p>
        <br>
        <p><i>Suppose a warrior, forgetting that he was already wearing his pearl on his forehead, were to seek for it elsewhere, he could travel the whole world without finding it. But if someone who knew what was wrong were to point it out to him, the warrior would immediately realize that the pearl had been there all the time.</i></p>
        <br>
        <p><i><b>So, if you students of the Way are mistaken about your own real Mind, not recognizing that it is the Buddha, you will consequently look for him elsewhere, indulging in various achievements and practices and expecting to attain realization by such graduated practices. But, even after aeons of diligent searching, you will not be able to attain to the Way.</b></i></p>
        <br>
        <p><i><b>These methods cannot be compared to the sudden elimination of conceptual thought, in the certain knowledge that there is nothing at all which has absolute existence, nothing on which to lay hold, nothing on which to rely, nothing in which to abide, nothing subjective or objective.</b></i></p>
        <br>
        <p><i>A Buddha has three bodies. By the Dharmakāya is meant the Dharma of the omnipresent voidness of the real self-existent Nature of everything. By the Sambhogakāya is meant the Dharma of the underlying universal purity of things. By the Nirmānakāya is meant the Dharmas of the six practices leading to Nirvāna and all other such devices.</i></p>
        <br>
        <p><i><b>The Dharma of the Dharmakāya cannot be sought through speech or hearing or the written word.</b></i></p>
        <br>
        <p><i><b>There is nothing which can be said or made evident.</b> There is just the omnipresent voidness of the real self-existent Nature of everything, and no more. Therefore, saying that there is no Dharma to be explained in words is called preaching the Dharma.</i></p>
        <br>
        <p><i>The Sambhogakāya and the Nirmānakāya both respond with appearances suited to particular circumstances.</i></p>
        <br>
        <p><i><b>Spoken Dharmas which respond to events through the senses and in all sorts of guises are none of them the real Dharma.</b></i></p>
        <br>
        <p><i><b>So it is said that the Sambhogakāya or the Nirmanakāya is not a real Buddha or preacher of the Dharma.
        </b></i></p>
        <br>
        <p><i>Q: If Mind and the Buddha are intrinsically one, should we continue to practise the six pāramitās and the other orthodox means of gaining Enlightenment?</i></p>
        <br>
        <p><i><b>A: Enlightenment springs from Mind, regardless of your practice of the six pāramitās and the rest. All such practices are merely expedients for handling ‘concrete' matters when dealing with the problems of daily life.</b></i></p>
        <br>
        <p><i><b>Even Enlightenment, the Absolute, Reality, Sudden Attainment, the Dharmakāya and all the others down to the Ten Stages of Progress, the Four Rewards of virtuous and wise living and the State of Holiness and Wisdom are—every one of them—mere concepts for helping us through samsara; they have nothing to do with the real Buddha-Mind.</b></i></p>
        <br>
        <p><i>Since Mind is the Buddha, the ideal way of attainment is to cultivate that Buddha-Mind. <b>Only avoid conceptual thoughts, which lead to becoming and cessation, to the afflictions of the sentient world and all the rest; then you will have no need of methods of Enlightenment and suchlike.</b></i></p>
        <br>
        <p><i><b>You have always been one with the Buddha, so do not pretend you can attain to this oneness by various practices.</b></i></p>
        <br>
        <p><i>Give up those erroneous thoughts leading to false distinctions! There is no ‘self' and no ‘other'. There is no ‘wrong desire', no ‘anger', no ‘hatred', no ‘love', no ‘victory', no ‘failure'. <b>Only renounce the error of intellectual or conceptual thought-processes and your nature will exhibit its pristine purity</b> for this alone is the way to attain Enlightenment, to observe the Dharma, to become a Buddha and all the rest.</i></p>
        <br>
        <p><i><b>Unless you understand this, the whole of your great learning, your painful efforts to advance, your austerities of diet and clothing, will not help you to a knowledge of your own Mind. All such practices must be termed fallacious, for any of them will lead to your rebirth among ‘demons'—enemies of the truth—or among the crude nature spirits.</b></i></p>
        <br>
        <p><i><b>What end is served by pursuits like those?</b></i></p>
        <br>
        <p><i>As it is, so long as your mind is subject to the slightest movement of thought, <b>you will remain engulfed in the error of taking ‘ignorant' and ‘Enlightened' for separate states;</b> this error will persist regardless of your vast knowledge of the Mahāyāna or of your ability to pass through the ‘Four Grades of Sainthood' and the ‘Ten Stages of Progress Leading to Enlightenment'.</i></p>
        <br>
        <p><i><b>For all these pursuits belong to what is ephemeral; even the most strenuous of your efforts is doomed to fail, just as an arrow shot never so high into the air must inevitably fall spent to the ground. So, in spite of them, you are certain to find yourselves back on the wheel of life and death.</b></i></p>
        <br>
        <p><i><b>Indulging in such practices implies your failure to understand the Buddha's real meaning.</b></i></p>
        <br>
        <p><i><b>With the practices of the Pure Land Buddhists it is also thus, for all these practices are productive of karma; hence, we may call them Buddha-hindrances!</b></i></p>
        <br>
        <p><i>As they would obstruct your Mind, the chain of causation would also grapple you fast, dragging you back into the state of those as yet unliberated.</i></p>
        <br>
        <p><i><b>Though others may talk of the Way of the Buddhas as something to be reached by various pious practices and by Sūtra-study, you must have nothing to do with such ideas.</b></i></p>
        <br>
        <p><i>A perception, sudden as blinking, that subject and object are one, will lead to a deeply mysterious wordless understanding; and by this understanding will you awake to the truth of Zen.</i></p>
        <br>
        <p><i>When you happen upon someone who has no understanding, you must claim to know nothing. He may be delighted by his discovery of some ‘way to Enlightenment'; yet if you allow yourselves to be persuaded by him, you will experience no delight at all, but suffer both sorrow and disappointment.</i></p>
        <br>
        <p><i><b>What have such thoughts as his to do with the study of Zen?</b></i></p>
        <br>
        <p><i><b>Even if you do obtain from him some trifling ‘method', it will only be a thought-constructed dharma having nothing to do with Zen.</b></i></p>
        <br>
        <p><i>Thus, Bodhidharma sat rapt in meditation before a wall; he did not seek to lead people into having opinions.</i></p>
        <br>
        <p><i>Therefore it is written: <b>"To put out of mind even the principle from which action springs is the true teaching of the Buddhas, while dualism belongs to the sphere of demons."</b></i></p>
        <br>
        <p><i><b>Your true nature is something never lost to you even in moments of delusion, nor is it gained at the moment of Enlightenment.</b> It is the Nature of the Bhūtatathatā.</i></p>
        <br>
        <p><i>In it is neither delusion nor right understanding. It fills the Void everywhere and is intrinsically of the substance of the One Mind.</i></p>
        <br>
        <p><i>How, then, can your mind-created objects exist outside the Void?</i></p>
        <br>
        <p><i>The Void is fundamentally without spacial dimensions, passions, activities, delusions or right understanding.</i></p>
        <br>
        <p><i><b>You must clearly understand that in it there are no things, no men and no Buddhas; for this Void contains not the smallest hairsbreadth of anything that can be viewed spatially; it depends on nothing and is attached to nothing.</b></i></p>
        <br>
        <p><i>It is all-pervading, spotless beauty; it is the self-existent and uncreated Absolute.</i></p>
        <br>
        <p><i><b>Then how can it even be a matter for discussion that the real Buddha has no mouth and preaches no Dharma, or that real hearing requires no ears, for who could hear it?</b></i></p>
        <br>
        <p><i>Ah, it is a jewel beyond all price!</i></p>

        <h3><u>[Caodong] What's In A Name?</u></h3>
        <h3>Green Sage</h3>
        <h3>4/18/2020</h3>
        <p>The term "Soto" comes from the Chinse <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caodong_school">"Caodong"</a>("ts'áo" - "dòng") (which "Soto Zen" arguably does not represent).

            The Chinese characters are as follows:</p>
        <br>
        <p><b>"曹洞"</b></p>
        <br>
        <p>[曹] - "cao" - see the various definitions, as this term has a deep history in the Chinese language. Notice how many have meanings having to do with waters and rivers, however, and see below for why that may be relevant.</p>
        <br>
        <p>[洞] - "dong" - "cave / hole / zero (unambiguous spoken form when spelling out numbers)"; "cavity" / "leak" / "hole"; etc. (Edit: Speculation: "source"?)</p>
        <br>
        <p>This "dong" is the same "dong" as found in the name of Master <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dongshan_Liangjie">[Dongshan Liangjie]</a> ( 洞山良价).</p>
        <br>
        <p>Popular understanding (myth?) claims that "Caodong" is a portmanteau of the names of <a href="https://pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caoshan_Benji">[Caoshan Benji]</a> and Dongshan.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Is this true though?</p>
        <br>
        <p>The following is an excerpt from Andy Ferguson, a well-known author, writing about the biography of Caoshan:</p>
        <br>
        <p><i>CAOSHAN BENJI (840–901) was a foremost disciple of Dongshan. He was so closely associated with his teacher that their names were used together to form the name of their Zen school, Caodong. Caoshan came from ancient Quanzhou (a place still called Quanzhou in modern Fujian Province). When a youth, he studied Confucianism. Leaving home at the age of nineteen, Caoshan entered Lingshi Monastery in Fuzhou. When he received ordination at the age of twenty-five, Zen Buddhism was flourishing in Tang dynasty China.

            Later, after becoming Dongshan’s Dharma heir, Caoshan started a new temple in Fuzhou and named it Cao Shan (Mt. Cao), after the Sixth Ancestor, whose mountain name was derived from Cao Xi (Cao Creek). Thereafter, Caoshan lived and taught at Mt. Heyu, and is said to have changed the name of that place to Cao Shan as well. Caoshan used Dongshan’s “five ranks” as a method of instruction, leading to its wide use in Zen monasteries. This helped differentiate Caodong Zen as a unique Zen school.</i></p>
        <br>
        <p><i>- A. Ferguson, Zen's Chinese Heritage: The Masters and Their Teachings, Wisdom Publications, 2011, pp. 242-246)</i></p>
        <br>
        <p>According to Ferguson, Caoshan's entire name appears to be an homage to "the Sixth Ancestor" of Zen, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huineng">[Huineng]</a>. This, to me, seems like a much more "Zen" thing to do than founding a "school" named after yourself.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Keep in mind that "Shan" [山] in Chinese means "mountain", and that mountain-/geographic-based naming conventions were a prominent aspect of not only the Zen tradition, but a general Chinese cultural tradition as well. This is what (I think) Ferguson means by the term "mountain name."</p>
        <br>
        <p>Regardless, both "Caoshan" and "Dongshan" were labels given to real, actual people who really didn't care a whole lot about labels.</p>
        <br>
        <p>I suspect that "Caodong" is a similar such label and probably developed after the fact in order to categorize an older tradition under scholarship. I'm not saying that's a bad thing, that's the same sort of thing we do here (well, some of us) and pretty much what I'm doing right now.</p>
        <br>
        <p>But the important thing is not to lose the thread; to be honest and clear about your knowledge.</p>
        <br>
        <p>In that light, let's consider the idea that the notion of "Caodong" as a portmanteau of "Caoshan" and "Dongshan" is actually a misunderstanding based on ad hoc scholarship.</p>
        <br>
        <p>In the Wiki entry for Dongshan, there is a section titled <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dongshan_Liangjie#Establishing_the_Caodong_school_of_Chan">"Establishing the Caodong school of Chan"</a> which, despite it's title, doesn't really explain how he allegedly did that:</p>
        <br>
        <p><i>At the age of fifty-two, Dongshan established a mountain school at the mountain named Dongshan (in what is now the city of Gao'an in Jiangxi province). The cloister temple he founded bore such names as Guanfu (広福寺), Gongde (功德寺), Chongxian Longbao (崇先隆報寺) but was named Puli Yuan (普利院) in the early Song dynasty period. Here, according to tradition, he composed the Song of the Precious Mirror Samādhi. His disciples here are said to have numbered between five hundred and one thousand.</i></p>
        <br>
        <p><i>This Caodong school became regarded as one of the Five Houses of Zen. At the time, they were just considered schools led by individualistic masters with distinct styles and personalities; in reality, the fact that they were all—with the exception of Linji—located in close geographic proximity to each other and that they all were at the height of their teaching around the same time, established a custom among students to routinely visit the other masters.</i></p>
        <br>
        <p>So, we see that Dongshan established a mountain school and either named himself after the mountain--just like many other masters did--or the mountain came to be associated with him afterwards; the school he founded was called many things over time; and it was at this school that Dongshan is said to have composed a famous poem.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Then we jump right to "The Caodong school became regarded as ..." ... wait, did I miss something?</p>
        <br>
        <p>Where was the naming?</p>
        <br>
        <p>In fact, the bolded part above seems to indicate that there was absolutely no tradition of creating an abstract name for a "school" and seeing it as an institution.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Amazingly, the Wiki entry for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caodong_school">"Caodong School"</a> basically echoes the doubts I'm raising in this OP, does nothing to address them, and in literally the next line (edit: if we ignore the sentence of lies right before it; sorry) completely forgets them and repeats the conventional "knowledge":</p>
        <br>
        <p><i>ETYMOLOGY</i></p>
        <br>
        <p><i>The key figure in the Caodong school was founder Dongshan Liangjie (807-869, Jpn. Tozan Ryokai). Some attribute the name "Cáodòng" as a union of "Dongshan" and "Caoshan", the latter from one of Dongshan's Dharma-heirs, Caoshan Benji; (840-901, Ts'ao-shan Pen-chi, Jpn. Sōzan Honjaku). <b>However, the "Cao" much more likely came from Cáoxī (曹溪), the "mountain-name" of Huineng, the Sixth Ancestor of Chan, as Caoshan was of little importance unlike his contemporary and fellow Dharma-heir, Yunju Daoying.</b> The school emphasised sitting meditation, and later "silent illumination" techniques.</i></p>
        <br>
        <p><i>HISTORY</i></p>
        <br>
        <p><i><b>The Caodong school was founded by Dongshan Liangjie and his Dharma-heir Caoshan Benji. Dongshan traced back his lineage to Shitou Xiqian (700-790), a contemporary of Mazu Daoyi (709–788).</b></i></p>
        <br>
        <p>So if Caoshan named himself (or was later named) after a mountain school which he himself named as an homage to the "mountain name" attributed to Huineng, which wasn't really a name taken from a mountain but from a river or stream, why would it make any sense that the "dong" in "Caodong" would refer to the mountain name of Dongshan with the intention of referring to the "person, Dongshan"?</p>
        <br>
        <p>Wouldn't it make more sense that the "Cao" was named after the "Cao" already well-known in the Zen tradition (which is what the above quote all-but says) and that the "Dong" would likewise follow suit?</p>
        <br>
        <p>Doesn't the dictionary definition for "Dong" intrigue you and seem much more appealing than simply being a superficial moniker?</p>
        <br>
        <p>I think Thomas Cleary's comments in his intro to the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Blue-Cliff-Record-Thomas-Cleary-ebook/dp/B00DMC5H8I/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&keywords=Blue+Cliff+Record&qid=1587206684&sr=8-1">Blue Cliff Record ("BCR")</a> presents good evidence:</p>
        <br>
        <p><i>Huineng had become enlightened in his mid-twenties while a poor woodcutter in the frontier lands of south China. He later traveled north to see Hongren workman in Hongren's community at Huangmei.</i></p>
        <br>
        <p><i>Hongren recognized Huineng's enlightenment and after a short time passed on to him the robe and bowl of Bodhidharma as symbols of the patriarchate; he did this in secret, it is said, and sent Huineng away, fearing the jealous wrath of the monks because Huineng was a peasant from the uncivilized far south with no formal training in Buddhism.</i></p>
        <br>
        <p><i>After fifteen years of wandering, Huineng reappeared in south China, became ordained as a Buddhist monk, and began to teach at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nanhua_Temple">Baolin Monastery</a> near the source of Cao <a href="https://dictionary.writtenchinese.com/#sk=%E6%BA%AA&svt=pinyin">[Xi]</a> in the Cao Valley River. (Note: I don't know if it's an error or an oversight, but it appears that Huineng went north again).</i></p>
        <br>
        <p><i>He awakened many people, and most of the teachers who appear in The Blue Cliff Record were descended from Huineng.</i></p>
        <br>
        <p>Cleary's account corroborates all which has been said up to here. Huineng ended up near a place that was already significant in Chinese culture called the "Cao Xi" in the Cao Valley and, since Huineng was essentially the source of all the major masters following him, the "Cao Xi" is a reference to his lineage and what he stood for.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Excerpts from the BCR back this up:</p>
        <br>
        <p>(Case 5)</p>
        <br>
        <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xuedou_Chongxian">[Xuedou's]</a> verse:</p>
        <br>
        <p><i>An ox head disappears,
            A horse head emerges.
            In the mirror of Cao Xi,^a absolutely no dust.
            He beats the drum for you to come look, but you don't see:
            When spring arrives, for whom do the hundred flowers bloom?</i></p>
        <br>
        <p>Footnote:</p>
        <br>
        <p><i>
            a. Cao Xi was the abode of the great Sixth Patriarch of Chinese Ch'an, Huineng (also known as 'workman Lu'), and is used to refer to him, as well as to his inspiration and lineage.</i></p>
        <br>
        <p>(Case 7)</p>
        <br>
        <p><i>One day when Fayen had ascended his seat, there was a monk who asked, "What is one drop from the fount of Cao Xi?"</i></p>
        <p><i>Fayen said, "It's one drop from the fount of Cao Xi."</i></p>
        <p><i>The monk was dumbfounded and withdrew; [National Teacher Deshao], who was in the assembly, was suddenly greatly enlightened when he heard this. Later he appeared in the world as one of Fayen's successors.</i></p>
        <br>
        <p>What did Deshao understand that enlightened him? And I am really curious as to what word is used for "fount" here ... something to look up later.</p>
        <br>
        <p>(Case 20)</p>
        <br>
        <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yuanwu_Keqin">[Yuanwu's]</a> 7th note to the case:</p>
        <br>
        <p><i><b>If the waves of Cao Xi resembled each other, endless numbers of ordinary people would get bogged down.</b> One punishment for all crimes; they're buried in the same pit.</i></p>
        <br>
        <p>We can also see from Yuanwu's commentary in the BCR that "Caodong" was a term already employed in the tradition during his lifetime (the 11th and 12th centuries).</p>
        <br>
        <p>(Case 16)</p>
        <br>
        <p><i>This monk (in the case) was also a guest of his house, and understood (Chingqing's) household affairs; therefore he questioned like this: "I am breaking out; I ask the Teacher to break in." Within <b>the Caodong tradition</b> this is called using phenomena to illustrate one's condition. How so? When the chick breaks out and the mother breaks in, naturally they are perfectly simultaneous.</i></p>
        <br>
        <p>From what I can tell, "Caodong" is only used twice in the BCR, and the next use of it completely contradicts the conventional claim:</p>
        <br>
        <p>(Case 89)</p>
        <br>
        <p><i>Yunyan and Daowu were fellow students under Yaoshan. For forty years Yunyan's side did not touch his mat. <b>Yaoshan produced the whole Caodong school.</b> There were three men with whom the Path of Dharma flourished: descended from Yunyen was Dongshan; descended from Daowu was Shishuang; and descended from Quanzhu was Jiashan.</i></p>
        <br>
        <p>So, according to Yuanwu, who was clearly aware of a "Caodong School" it was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yaoshan_Weiyan">[Yaoshan Weiyan]</a> who founded the Caodong school.</p>
        <br>
        <p>It may be more likely that Dongshan's nomiker was influenced by his relationship to the "Caodong School" <b>and not the other way around.</b></p>
        <br>
        <p>This makes much more sense given everything else we see in the Zen tradition and means that the term "Caodong" is itself a device or entryway to understanding, not some ego-centric sectarian category.</p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>LMAO, a very important "P.S." to add here, and another terrific self-pwn by Dogen (I really couldn't hate the guy at this point, I can't help but feel some pity for him haha)</p>
        <br>
        <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S%C5%8Dt%C5%8D#Chinese_origins">(From Wiki: "Soto Zen" : "Chinese Origins")</a></p>
        <br>
        <p><i>One prevalent view is that the sect's name was originally formed by taking one character each from the names of Dòngshān and his disciple Cáoshān Běnjì (曹山本寂, Japanese: Sōzan Honjaku), and was originally called Dòngcáo-zōng (with the characters in transposed order).</i></p>
        <p><i><b>However, to paraphrase the Dòngshān yǔlù (《洞山語録》, "Record of the Dialogues of Dòngshān"), the sect's name denotes 'colleagues (曹) of the teachings above the caves (洞)' who together follow the "black wind"[citation needed] and admire the masters of various sects.</b></i></p>
        <p><i>Perhaps more significantly for the Japanese brand of this sect, <b>Dōgen among others advocated the reinterpretation that the "Cao" represents not Caoshan, but rather "Huineng of Caoxi temple" 曹渓慧能 (Sōkei Enō); zh:曹溪慧能).</b> The branch that was founded by Caoshan died off, and Dōgen was a student of the other branch that survived in China.</i></p>
        <br>
        <p>So Dogen himself advocates for an equivalent or similar understanding of "CaoDong" and further admits that he was not in the "Caodong" lineage which would fit, what I will now call, the conventional myth (i.e. the "lineage" supposedly founded by Caoshan Benji).</p>
        <br>
        <p>He ties himself to Dongshan, which I don't think will end well for Dogen. If I had to speculate, I'd say he did this to add legitimacy to his own school under the assumption (correct at the time) that people couldn't fact-check his claims by comparing his teachings to Dongshan's record or ... worse ... those masters preceding Dongshan. But now that we can, this gamble comes back to bite Dogen's entire school.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Anyway, I think the next text that warrants a visit is the Dongshan yulu.</p>

        <p><i>There’s a kind of bald monk who says to students: "Buddha is the ultimate. You only achieve enlightenment after the fulfillment of the results of three immeasurable eons of cultivating practice."</i></p>
        <br>
        <p><i>Good people, if you think Buddha is the ultimate, then why did he lie down and die at the age of eighty between the twin trees in <a href="https://www.matthieuricard.org/en/blog/posts/kusinagar-where-the-buddha-passed-into-parinirvana">{the grove at Kusinagara?}</a></i></p>
        <br>
        <p><i>Where is Buddha today?</i></p>
        <br>
        <p><i>It’s clear that he was born and died no different from us.</i></p>
        <br>
        <p><i>You might say that the thirty-two auspicious marks and the eighty excellent qualities make him a buddha, and a wheel-turning sage king must be a tathagata. But you should understand clearly that these are all illusory apparitions.</i></p>
        <br>
        <p><i>The man of old [Mahasattva Fu] said: "The tathagatas take on bodily form in order to accord with worldly feelings. Fearing people would form nihilistic views, [Buddha] provisionally established some empty names, temporarily talking of the thirty-two marks and the eighty excellent qualities. These too are empty words. If there is a body, it’s not the essential body of enlightenment. Formlessness is the true shape."</i></p>
        <br>
        <p><i>You may say that Buddha has six spiritual powers that are inconceivable. But all the devas, the immortals, the asuras, and the powerful demons also have spiritual powers. Does this mean they must be buddhas too? Don’t go wrong about this.</i></p>
        <br>
        <p><i>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asura">{Asuras}</a> did battle with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indra">{Indra}</a>, king of the gods, and when they were defeated, they gathered together their host of 84,000 and hid in a hole in a lotus fiber.</i></p>
        <br>
        <p><i>Isn’t this supernatural?</i></p>
        <br>
        <p><i>All these examples I’ve cited are cases of spiritual powers due to karma and dependent [on contrived techniques]. In the case of the Buddha’s six spiritual powers, it is not so.</i></p>
        <br>
        <p><i>Buddha enters form, sound, smell, taste, touch, and concepts without being deluded by them.</i></p>
        <br>
        <p><i>Thus, since he has arrived at the emptiness of form, sound, smell, taste, touch, and concepts, these cannot bind the independent person of the Path.</i></p>
        <br>
        <p><i>For him, even the defiled body of form, sensation, conception, motivation, and consciousness is in itself a spiritual power for walking upon the earth.</i></p>
        <br>
        <h3><i>Good people, the real Buddha is formless; the real Dharma has no marks.</i></h3>
        <br>
        <p><i>The way you are acting is to erect models and patterns based upon the illusory transformations [which were provisionally put forward in the Buddhist teachings]. Even if you get something from this, you are all wild fox spirits. This is not real Buddhism at all, but the view of outsiders.</i></p>
        <br>
        <p><i>People who study the Path genuinely do not grasp buddhas or bodhisattvas or arhats; they do not grasp attainments of special excellence within the triple world.</i></p>
        <br>
        <p><i>They are transcendent and free and on their own—they are not constrained by things.</i></p>
        <br>
        <p><i>Even if heaven and earth turn upside down, they are not in doubt.</i></p>
        <br>
        <p><i>If all the buddhas of the ten directions appear before them, they feel no joy.</i></p>
        <br>
        <p><i>If [all the torments of] the hungry ghosts, the animals, and the beings in hell appear before them, they feel no fear.</i></p>
        <br>
        <p><i>Why are they like this?</i></p>
        <br>
        <p><i>They see the emptiness of all phenomena, which exist through transformation and don’t exist without it. They see that the triple world is only mind, and the myriad things are only consciousness.</i></p>
        <br>
        <p><i>Therefore, why bother to grasp [what are really] dreamlike illusions and apparitions?</i></p>
        <br>
        <h3><i>There is only the person in all of you right here and now listening to the Dharma.</i></h3>
        <br>
        <h3><i>This person enters fire without being burned and water without being drowned. This person enters the mires of hell as if strolling in a garden sightseeing. This person enters the planes of the hungry ghosts and animals without being subject to their suffering.</i></h3>
        <br>
        <p><i>Why so?</i></p>
        <br>
        <p><i>Because for this person there is nothing to reject, nothing to avoid.</i></p>
        <br>
        <h3><i>If you love the holy and hate the ordinary, you float and sink in the sea of birth and death.</i></h3>
        <br>
        <p><i>Affliction exists because of mind: if you have no mind, how can affliction hold you?</i></p>
        <br>
        <p><i>If you do not try to discriminate and grasp forms, naturally you find the Path that instant.</i></p>

        <br>
        <p><i>These two are each distinct; how do you understand the logic of identity? You have to experience the mind without seeking; then they will integrate and you will get to be trouble-free.</i></p>

        <p><i>Even if you trust directly in the rightness of reality this very moment, already you are called a dullard; how much the more if you cannot trust directly— what are you good for then?</i></p>
        <br>

        <h3><u>Greensight / Highdea: Zazen is an Insidious Placebo</u></h3>
        <h3>Green Sage</h3>
        <h3>3/10/2020</h3>
        <p>I was thinking about ways in which people are "enlightened" but don't realize it, and realized that if people penetrate deeply in connection with a zazen experience, they probably do actually penetrate deeply BUT because they are so convinced that it was "the zazen" it's forever out of their reach.</p>
        <br>
        <p>It's worse than someone who hasn't penetrated at all, because though that person may have more difficulties or take longer (for the sake of argument) than someone who penetrates via zazen ... that person will have no other "thing" to blame/credit for the penetration except themselves and so they will see.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Whereas the zazen practitioner, though they may have penetrated, cannot believe (or will have a tough time believing) that the zazen wasn't responsible; that it was just them all along.</p>
        <br>
        <p>What's really disturbing is that their confusion is completely understandable given their experience. Hence why I say it is an "insidious placebo."</p>
        <br>
        <p>It's like a placebo that is also a drug.</p>
        <br>
        <p>The more I examine the connection, the more I am convinced zazen is just a drugless-drug.</p>
        <br>
        <p>To me, it's like taking acid: if the experience is transparent to you, and you know it's your mind, not the acid/zazen that is directing the experience, then it can be a very beautiful and valuable experience for the practitioner ... but it's constantly begging to entangle with your understanding and graft onto it like a parasite.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Anyway, I just figured as long as everyone else was shit-posting their Woke Strokes I could get in on the fun. XD</p>

        <p><i>(Record of Linji; Cleary translation)</i></p>
        <br>
        <p><i>I explain the Dharma differently from anyone else.
        </i></p>
        <br>
        <p><i>If {Manjushri} or {Samantabhadra} appear before me in some manifestation to ask about the Dharma, as soon as they open their mouths to ask for instruction, I’ve already sized them up.</i></p>
        <br>
        <p><i>I am securely seated.</i></p>
        <br>
        <p><i>When you people come to meet with me, I have already sized you all up.</i></p>
        <br>
        <p><i>Why is it this way?</i></p>
        <br>
        <p><i>Because my perception is different.</i></p>
        <br>
        <p><i>Externally I do not seize upon ordinary or holy, and inwardly I do not abide in the [fundamental].</i></p>
        <br>
        <p><i>When you see all the way through things, there are no more doubts or deceptions.</i></p>
        <br>
        <p><i>The Buddha Dharma is effortless:</i></p>
        <br>
        <p><i>Just be without concerns in your ordinary life, as you shit and piss and wear clothes and eat food.</i></p>
        <br>
        <p><i>When tired, then lie down.</i></p>
        <br>
        <p><i>Fools will laugh at you, but the wise will know.</i></p>
        <br>
        <p><i>An ancient said: "Those who make external efforts are all stupid and obstinate. Just act the master wherever you are, and where you stand is real."</i></p>
        <br>
        <p><i>When objects appear they cannot turn you around. Though the uninterrupted hellish karma of the habit energy of your past is still there, it spontaneously becomes the great ocean of liberation.</i></p>
        <br>
        <p><i>These days students in general do not know the Dharma.They are like goats:</i></p>
        <br>
        <p><i>Whatever they encounter, they put in their mouths.</i></p>
        <br>
        <p><i>They do not distinguish between the slaves and the free, the guests and the host.</i></p>
        <br>
        <p><i>This type enter the Path with twisted minds. Even though they cannot enter places where it’s noisy, they call themselves true leavers of home. Actually they are true conventional worldlings.</i></p>
        <br>
        <p><i>As for leavers of home, they must be able to perceive with true understanding in ordinary life. They distinguish enlightenment and delusion, true and false, ordinary and holy. If you can make these distinctions, you are called a true leaver of home. If you cannot tell deluding from enlightening influences, then you have left one home [ordinary life] only to enter another home [cultish ‘religious’ allegiances]. Then you are called a sentient being creating karma, not a true leaver of home.</i></p>
        <br>
        <p><i>Right now there’s something where enlightenment and delusion share the same substance undivided. It’s like water and milk mixed together: the king goose drinks only the milk.
        </i></p>
        <br>
        <h3><i>People of the Path with clear eyes will reject both delusion and enlightenment. If you love holy things and hate ordinary things, you float and sink in the sea of birth and death.</i></h3>
        <br>
        <p><i>Someone asked: “What are enlightenment and delusion?”</i></p>
        <br>
        <p><i>Linji said: "A moment when your mind is in doubt is delusion. If you can comprehend that the myriad phenomena are unborn, that [deluded] mind is like an illusory transformation, so that you are everywhere pure, this is enlightenment. So enlightenment and delusion are the two objects, defilement and purity."</i></p>
        <br>
        <p><i>“In my view, there are no buddhas and no sentient beings, no ancient and no modern."</i></p>
        <br>
        <p><i>"Those who attain, attain without cultivation, without realization, without gain, and without loss, for them there is never anything else but reality. ‘Even if there is anything that goes beyond this, I would say that it is like a dream or a magical illusion.’ This is what I am saying."</i></p>

        <p>The following is included at the end of Cleary's translation of The Blue Cliff Record. As Cleary notes, the source is "Shigetsu Ein's Funogo san ro, da, shi i rui, a 'Non-talk on the three roads, (three) falls, and four different kinds' (1761). Shigetsu was a Soto Zen master, a Japanese descendant of Caodong Zen."</p>

        <p><b>So take words like "attainment" with a grain of salt.</b></p>
        <br>
        <p>And for that reason, further compare with <a href="https://selfdefinition.org/zen/dongshan/thomas-cleary-comments-on-five-ranks-etc.htm">[these excerpts of Cleary's own descriptions of Dongshan's devices]</a> and for even further authenticity, go straight to Dongshan himself.</p>

        <p><i>(Blue Cliff Record; Cleary translation)</i></p>
        <br>
        <h3><i>For innumerable aeons, since there has been self, this stinking skinbag has been changed from time to time, transformed from place to place, in a thousand conditions, ten thousand forms; who can reach the realm of our fundamental quiescence?</i></h3>
        <br>
        <p><i>If you get here, you must know this road. "This road" means while dwelling in the present heap of sound and form, first getting rid of clinging to self, and attaining our former original state of selflessness. And furthermore, you must know that all things have no self. Once person and things are selfless, in your daily activities you walk in the void. This life basically has an undefiled practice and experience; thus would we practice and experience nondefilement. Today you must diligently walk in the void. Walking in the void is not some special art; each day when you go into the hall, you should not chew through a single grain of rice. Not chewing through a single grain of rice means that there is no breaking of the fast or violation of discipline by arousing mindfulness of tasting flavor. This is called traveling the bird's path.</i></p>
        <br>
        <p><i>Travel on the bird's path is trackless; when you don't leave your body in the realm of tracklessness, this is the turning point of an ascetic. After you have arrived here and settled here, there is still one road going beyond. This road is not in going or coming; it is what is called "moss growing in the jade palace." All the names of the Other Side are temporary names for this. In reality, it is the one road that cannot be touched upon. That is why we say "hidden." And "hidden" is not a matter of giving a name as its meaning; the realm called the hidden road is the realm of no name or meaning. This is why it is said, "He has no country; he does not abide, dwells in no home."</i></p>
        <br>
        <p><i>To know this and yet be able to not remain here, to be an example for beings, to inspire and lead them, unify and teach them, is called "extending the hands." In extending the hands, there is no separate road; it does not transgress the bird's path. Traveling the bird's path by yourself, yet you extend your hands. In the bird's path there is no separate road; knowing the hidden road yourself, you still don't transgress it. Dwelling in the bird's path, you don't sprout horns on your head but always extend your hands.</i></p>
        <br>
        <p><i>Thus the three roads are the cause and effect of the great practice; and the cause and effect spreads vast and wide throughout the whole universe.</i></p>

        <h3><u>[Kashyapa] Kashyapa! Kashyapa! Wherefore art thou Kashyapa?!</u></h3>
        <h3>Green Sage</h3>
        <h3>3/04/2020</h3>
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kashyapa">(Wikipedia:)</a>
        <br>
        <p><i>[Kashyapa] is a revered Vedic sage of Hinduism. He was one of the Saptarishis, the seven ancient sages of the Rigveda, numerous Sanskrit texts and Indian mythologies. He is the most ancient rishi listed in the colophon verse in the Brihadaranyaka Upanishad.</i></p>
        <br>
        <p><i>Kashyapa is a common ancient name, referring to many different personalities in the ancient Hindu and Buddhist texts.</i></p>
        <p><i>Kaśyapa, alternatively kacchapa, means "turtle" in Sanskrit. According to Michael Witzel, it is related to Avestan kasiiapa, Sogdian kyšph, New Persian kašaf, kaš(a)p which mean "tortoise", after which Kashaf Rūd or a river in Turkmenistan and Khorasan is named. Other relations include to Tokarian B kaccāp ("brainpan"), Polish kacap (czerep, "brainpan", "hardliner"), Tokarian A kāccap ("turtle", "tortoise"). Frits Staal agrees that Kaśyapa means tortoise but believes that it is a non-Indo-European word.</i></p>
        <br>
        <p><i>In Buddhist Pali canonical texts such as Digha Nikaya, Tevijja Sutta describes a discussion between the Buddha and Vedic scholars of his time. The Buddha names ten rishis, calls them "early sages" and makers of ancient verses that have been collected and chanted in his era, and among those ten rishi is [Kassapa] (the Pali spelling of Kashyapa in Sanskrit).</i></p>
        <br>
        <p><i>(Blue Cliff Record:)</i></p>
        <br>
        <h3><i>Yunmen showed his staff to the assembly and said, "The staff has changed into a dragon and swallowed the universe. Mountains, rivers, the great earth--where are they to be found?"</i></h3>
        <br>
        <p><i>As for Yunmen's saying, "The staff has changed into a dragon and swallowed the universe. Where are the mountains, rivers, and earth to be found?" If you say it exists, then you are blind; if you say it doesn't exist, then you are dead. Do you see where Yunmen helped people? Bring the staff back to me!</i></p>
        <br>
        <p><i><b>People these days do not understand where Yunmen stood alone and revealed. Instead they say that he went to form to explain mind, that he relied on things to reveal principle. But old Shakyamuni couldn't have not known this theory as he taught the Dharma for forty-nine years; why then did he also need to hold up the flower for Kashyapa's smile? This old fellow caused confusion saying, "I have the treasury of the eye of the correct teaching, the wondrous mind of nirvana--these I pass on to MahaKashyapa." Why was there still a need for the specially transmitted mind seal? Given that all of you are guests in the house of the ancestral teachers, do you understand this specially transmitted mind?</b></i></p>
        <br>
        <p><i>If there is a single thing in your breast, then mountains, rivers, and the great earth appear in profusion before you; if there isn't a single thing in your breast, then outside there is not so much as a fine hair. How can you talk about principle and knowledge fusing, about objective world and mind merging? What's the reason? When one is understood, all are understood; when one is clear, all are clear.</i></p>
        <br>
        <p><i>(BCR:)</i></p>
        <br>
        <p><i>Stand on the summit of the highest peak, and demons and outsiders cannot know you; walk on the bottom of the deepest sea, and even the Buddha's eye cannot catch sight of you. Even if your eyes are like shooting stars and your intellect is like flashing lightning, still you won't avoid (being like) the spirit tortoise dragging his tail (leaving traces.) At this point, what is proper?</i></p>

        <h3><u>[Huangbo] "The Way" is just a figure of speech ...</u></h3>
        <h3>Green Sage</h3>
        <h3>3/03/2020</h3>
        <p>A little mellow Huangbo for your Tuesday day cruising, buddhas and budhettes, wherever you are out there in the Buddhasphere, driving around in your little vehicles.</p>
        <br>
        <p>This is Radio Buddha, bringing you all the mellow vibes for your karmic drives, kalpa in and kalpa out.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Huangbo singing us a little tune in his classic style. Though he uses buddhist language and imagery, he massages it to accord with the Way; either "clarifying" or "re-defining it", that's up to you.</p>
        <br>
        <p>One Mind y'all.</p>
        <br>
        <p><i>(Huangbo, Mind Transmission; translated by Blofeld)</i></p>
        <p><i>Regarding this Zen Doctrine of ours, since it was first transmitted, it has never taught that people should seek for learning or form concepts.</i></p>
        <br>
        <p><i>"Studying the Way" is just a figure of speech.</i></p>
        <br>
        <p><i>It is a method of arousing people's interest in the early stages of their development. In fact, the Way is not something which can be studied. Study leads to the retention of concepts and so the Way is entirely misunderstood. Moreover, the Way is not something specially existing; it is called the Mahāyāna (Great Vehicle) Mind—Mind which is not to be found inside, outside or in the middle.</i></p>
        <br>
        <p><i>Truly it is not located anywhere.</i></p>
        <br>
        <p><i>The first step is to refrain from knowledge-based concepts. This implies that if you were to follow the empirical method to the utmost limit, on reaching that limit you would still be unable to locate Mind.</i></p>
        <br>
        <p><i>The Way is spiritual truth and was originally without name or title. It was only because people ignorantly sought for it empirically that the Buddhas appeared and taught them to eradicate this method of approach. Fearing that nobody would understand, they selected the name "Way"("Dao").</i></p>
        <br>
        <p><i>You must not allow this name to lead you into forming a mental concept of a road. So it is said, "When the fish is caught we pay no more attention to the trap."</i></p>
        <br>
        <p><i>When body and mind achieve spontaneity, the Way is reached and Mind is understood. A [sramana] is so called because he has penetrated to the original source of all things. The fruit of attaining the sramana stage is gained by putting an end to all anxiety; it does not come from book-learning.</i></p>

        <h3><u>[Linji] Cultivating Sages is for Blind Shavepate</u></h3>
        <h3>Green Sage</h3>
        <h3>3/02/2020</h3>
        <p><i>(Record of Linji; Cleary translation)</i></p>
        <p><i>Outside of mind there is nothing, and what is within mind is also unattainable. What are you looking for? All of you people everywhere talk of having cultivation and having realization, but don’t make this mistake. Even if you gain something from cultivation, it is just the karma of birth and death. You say you cultivate the six perfections and the myriad practices, but as I see it you are just building karma. When you seek Buddha and seek the Dharma, you are creating hellish karma. When you seek to be bodhisattvas, you are also creating karma. When you read the sutras, you are also creating karma. The buddhas and ancestral teachers were people without concerns. Thus they make nothing but pure karma, whether they are in the defiled realm of contrived action, or in the stainless realm without contrived action.</i></p>
        <br>
        <p><i>There are a certain kind of blind shave-pates who eat their fill of food and then go to sit in meditation. They grab hold of wayward thoughts and do not let them go on. Weary of noise, they seek quietude. These are not Buddhist methods. The ancestral teacher [Shenhui of Heze] said: "If you fixate your mind and contemplate stillness, hold up your mind for outer awareness and hold in your mind for inner realization, freeze your mind and enter stable concentration, this is all contrived activity."</i></p>
        <br>
        <p><i>It is the person in you who is listening to the Dharma this way right now. How can you try to cultivate this person or realize him or adorn him? He is not something that can be cultivated or adorned. If we would have him adorned, in fact all things are what adorn him</i></p>
        <br>
        <p>.......</p>
        <br>
        <p><i>Good people, if you can comprehend like this, you will avoid being obstructed by ordinary and holy names. [Otherwise, as usual] you interpret the empty fist as if it really held something and vainly concoct strange things among the elements of sensory experience. You slight yourselves when you bow out saying that you are only ordinary people, while those [who succeeded on the Path] were sages.</i></p>
        <br>
        <p><i>You shaven-headed ones with many births to go, what is the big hurry? You have put on a lion’s skin, yet you howl like little foxes. You are really great people, but you do not breathe with the energy of the really great. You refuse to believe in what’s in your own house, and instead go seeking outside like this. You fall into traps with the empty and free names and formulations used by the ancients and try to make patterns of categories by depending on them, but you are unable to comprehend them on your own. When you encounter objects you become entangled; when you meet with sensory experiences you grasp them. Delusion arises everywhere you touch; you have no sure stability of your own.</i></p>
        <br>
        <p><i>Good people of the Path, do not grasp what I say. Why? Because verbal explanations have no basis: they are temporary sketches on the void, like images formed of colored clouds. Good people, do not think ‘Buddha’ is the ultimate. I see [such dualistic views of an external buddha] as a stink-hole. [Concepts of] ‘bodhisattva’ and ‘arhat’ are fetters and chains, things to bind people with. That’s why [in the stories in the sutras] [Manjusri] slew Buddha with his sword and [Angulimala] took his knife and wounded Buddha. Good people, there is no buddha that can be attained. Even the three vehicles, the five categories of beings, the round and the sudden manifestations of the teachings, [and all Buddhist formulations] are all just medicines to deal with the diseases of a certain period. There is no real doctrine at all. If there are [doctrinal teachings], they are open announcements that show some semblance of [real truth], public verbal demonstrations. Arranged for effect, they explain as they do for the time being.</i></p>
        <br>
        <p><i>Good people, there are some misguided monks who attach their efforts to what is in these teachings, trying to find a world-transcending truth, but they are making a mistake. If people seek Buddha, they lose Buddha; if they seek the Path, they lose the Path; if they seek the patriarchs, they lose the patriarchs.</i></p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>Don't seek, and you shall find.</p>
        <p>Only one way to find out ...</p>

            <br>
            <p><i>“To misinterpret the Dharma and make a mistake yourself might be acceptable, but to exhort others to do the same is unacceptable. In your own confusion you do not see, and, moreover you slander the Buddha’s Sutras. Therefore no-thought is established as the doctrine. “Good Knowing Advisors, why is no-thought established as the doctrine? Because there are confused people who speak of seeing their own nature, and yet they produce thought with regard to states. Their thoughts cause deviant views to arise, and from that all defilement and false thinking are created. Originally, not one single dharma can be obtained in the self-nature. If there is something to attain, or false talk of misfortune and blessing, that is just defilement and deviant views. Therefore, this Dharma-door establishes no-thought as its doctrine.</i></p>
            <p>English translation by the Buddhist Text Translation Society</p>
            <br>
            <p><i>“Good friends, why is it that nonthought is taken as the central doctrine? If you depend merely on oral explanations of seeing the nature, [like a] deluded person you will have thoughts relative to the realms and you will even activate false views regarding those thoughts. And from this will be generated all the enervating defilements and false thoughts! There is in the self-nature fundamentally not a single dharma that can be perceived. To think that there were any would be a false explanation, a disaster, a false view of enervating defilements. Therefore, this teaching takes nonthought as its central doctrine.</i></p>

            <br>
            <p><i>If you do not know the intention of the teaching, you go wrong yourself, and can also mislead others. Your self-delusion is not visible to you. You even misrepresent Buddhist scriptures. That is why we establish freedom from thought as the source.

                Good friends, how do we establish freedom from thought as the source? Deluded people who only talk about seeing essential nature have thoughts about objects, then create false views based on these thoughts; all worldly troubles and erroneous ideas come from this. In our own essential nature there is basically not a single thing that can be grasped. If you grasp anything supposedly bad or good, this is worldly trouble, a false view. Therefore this teaching establishes freedom from thought as the source.</i></p>

            <h3>12/26/2019</h3>
            <p><i>Talking about emptiness all day does not say a single word. If you say he has a doctrine, you are slandering the Realized One. Therefore the sutra follows up with a section on not preaching a doctrine.</i></p>
            <br>
            <p><i><b>"Subhuti, do not say that the Realized One entertains this thought: 'I should preach some doctrine.' Do not entertain this thought. Why? If any say the Realized One preaches any doctrine, they are slandering the Buddha, because they cannot understand what I say. Subhuti, the explanation of the teaching is that there is no doctrine to preach---that is called teaching."</b></i></p>
            <br>
            <p><i>When ordinary people preach, they have a sense of accomplishment. Therefore the Buddha tells Subhuti that when the Realized One teaches, he has no sense of accomplishment. Ordinary people preach with a sense of being able to understand. The Realized One's speech and silence are both spontaneous; the words he utters are like echoes responding to sounds, occurring naturally without deliberate intent, not the same as the ordinary man preaching with a fluctuating mind. If any say that the Realized One preaches with fluctuating in his mind, they are slandering Buddha. The Sutra of Vimalakirti says, "Real teaching involves no preaching, no giving orders; you realized that myriad things are empty, and all names and words are temporary setups; constructed within inherent emptiness, all the verbal expositions explain that all realities are signless and unfabricated, thus guiding deluded people in such a way as to get them to see their original nature and cultivate and realized unsurpassed enlightenment.</i></p>

            <p>I often see many get hung up on exact definitions or meanings of particular phrases etc. seeking to understand through an intellectual pursuit of the dharma. They may be confusing the finger pointing at the moon with the actual moon. There are many modern teachers who have made it their business to convince others to be hung up on mantras or one idea/concept but when we can look at these zen texts and remember that real teaching involves no preaching and no giving orders!</p>
