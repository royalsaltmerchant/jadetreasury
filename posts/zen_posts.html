        <h3>Diamonds: No Liver Of Life (Views Do Not Occur)</h3>
        <h3>Royal Salt Merchant</h3>
        <h3>11/6/2020</h3>
        <h3>NO LIVER OF LIFE!</h3>
        <br>
        <p><i>&quot;Subhuti, if someone says that the Buddha expounds the notion of self, the notion of a person, the notion of a being, or the notion of a liver of life<em>, do you think this person understands the principles I expound?&quot;</em></i></p>
        <p><i>&quot;World Honored One, this person does not understand the principles expounded by the Realized One. Why? The World Honored one says that the notion of self, the notion of person, the notion of a being, and the notion of a liver of life are not a notion of self, a notion of a person, a notion of a being, or a notion of a liver of life<em>,</em> they are called the notion of a self, the notion of a person, the notion of a being, and the notion of a liver of life.&quot;</i></p>
        <p><i>(Quote from the Diamond Sutra within Hui-neng&#39;s commentary on the diamond sutra from &quot;The Sutra of Hui-Neng&quot; Translated by Thomas Cleary)</i></p>
        <br>
        <p>What are the Implications of this matter of there being &quot;no liver of life&quot;?
        A mind, previously believing itself to be the controller(&quot;a liver of life&quot;) of the body/brain, has built up many habits for coping with the fears of “mismanagement”. This mind can witness itself going about these coping habits and notice that, since it no longer recognizes itself as a controller(&quot;a liver of life&quot;), these habits, of trying to maintain a notion of control, are simply a waste of energy.</p>
        <p>Already there has been a return back to an earlier state of mind which does not assert this notion of a self.
        When thoughts come by, it begins to question the usefulness of that pattern. If that pattern is not so useful under the new premise, or “no-premise”, it seems to fade from continuing. The mind, watching patterns, allows the brain to gain more insight into the patterns being watched. If the mind attempts to override the brain in its decision making, there is a dissonance, since the mind ultimately has no control, and it stumbles over itself with frustration in futility. The mind does not have this ability.</p>
        <p>The mind, recognizing that it’s own nature is not to make decisions(&quot;no liver of life&quot;) but to observe, in accordance, it develops new(or perhaps &quot;original/ordinary&quot;) habits, which involve anxiety less and less. The mind, which is seated in its home position of awareness (having returned to ordinary), reflects the information it may witness back to the brain with clarity. This “unbecoming”, of releasing unnecessary mental patterns, can take awhile as the mind has to be witness to its own machinations through self-reflection. The more it corrects, the quieter it becomes; the quieter it becomes, the less time is needed for reflecting on habits which no longer are viewed as useful.</p>
        <p>Energy redirected.</p>
        <br>
        <p>How does one cease this activity and redirect energy?
        What do we call this original mind which is not wasting energy? Lets look at Joshu and Nansen....</p>
        <br>
        <p><i>The master asked Nan-ch&#39;uan(Nansen), &quot;What is the Way?&quot;</p>
        <p><em>Nan-ch&#39;uan said, &quot;</em>Ordinary mind is the Way.&quot;</p>
        <p>The master said, &quot;Then may I direct myself towards it or not?&quot;</p>
        <p>Nan-ch&#39;uan said, &quot;To seek [it] is to deviate [from it].&quot;</p>
        <p>The master said, &quot;If I do not seek, how can I know about the Way?&quot;</p>
        <p>Nan-chu&#39;an said, &quot;The Way does not belong to knowing or not knowing. To know is to have a concept; to not know is to be ignorant. If you truly realize the Way of no doubt, it is just like the sky: wide open vast emptiness. How can you say &#39;yes&#39; or &#39;no&#39; to it?&quot;</p>
        <p>At these words the master had sudden enlightenment. His mind became like the clear moon.</p>
        <p>(Recorded sayings of zen master Joshu translated by James Green)</i></p>
        <br>
        <p>His mind became LIKE the clear moon, it reflected back to him with clarity.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Patterns(concepts) created by observation can be most useful when they aren’t taken as ultimate!
        Remembering that patterns are originated from the mind, and that, outside this pattern recognition there are no myriad things or events, the mind knows its own fallibility and cannot rely upon its own nature to the fullest. Knowing it’s fallibility, it knows that it ultimately “does not know”. In this way, It can use “knowing” without being attached to “knowing”, and be seated in “unknowing”. It is &quot;not blind to causality&quot;.</p>
        <p>However recognizing that it’s ability to create patterns, it recognizes that this nature is what allows it to provide the brain with information which can be used for survival and living, therefore being able to trust that it’s own nature is enough to maintain a reasonable reliance (but not totally abiding in) in its own “knowing”, and in this reliance, also not being attached to “unknowing”. Not being attached to it’s own knowing or it’s unknowing, &quot;trusting&quot; that both exist to maintain this life. It goes about in its “normal”(ordinary) state regardless of what may happen.</p>
        <p>Knowing or unknowing, it knows this way, or that way, is still the way; either way will have to do! And either or may occur! Simply avoiding picking and choosing, not attempting to interfere with the outcome which manifests as the body’s action.</p>
        <br>
        <p>More from Joshu on &quot;Picking and Choosing&quot;</p>
        <br>
        <p><i>Chao-chou, teaching the assembly, said, “The Ultimate Path is without difficulty; just avoid picking and choosing. As soon as there are words spoken, ‘this is picking and choosing, this is clarity.’ This old monk does not abide within clarity; do you still preserve anything or not?”</p>
        <p>At that time a certain monk asked, “Since you do not abide within clarity, what do you preserve?”</p>
        <p>Chao-chou replied, “I don’t know either.”</p>
        <p>The monk said, “Since you don’t know, Teacher, why do you nevertheless say that you do not abide within clarity?”</p>
        <p>Chao-chou said, “It is enough to ask about the matter; bow and withdraw.”</p>
        <p>(Blue Cliff Record, Case 2)</i></p>
        <br>
        <p>another example of this in more detail which also sets zen apart from other sects of Buddhism...</p>
        <br>
        <p><i>That which is called the Mirror of Concentration and Wisdom (another reference to non-Zen Mahayana doctrine) requires the use of sight, hearing, feeling and cognition, which lead to successive states of calm and agitation. But these involve conceptions based on environmental objects; they are temporary expedients appertaining to one of the lower categories of &#39;roots of goodness&#39;. And this category of &#39;roots of goodness&#39; merely enables people to understand what is said to them. If you wish to experience Enlightenment yourselves, you must not indulge in such conceptions<em>. They are all environmental Dharmas concerning things which are and things which are</em> not, based on existence and non-existence. If only you will avoid concepts of existence and non-existence in regard to absolutely everything<em>, you will then perceive the Dharma.</em></p>
        <p>(HuangPo, on theTransmission of Mind translated by John Blofeld)</i></p>
        <br>
        <p>&quot;existence AND non-existence&quot; neither completely abiding in &quot;knowing&quot; or &quot;unknowing&quot;</p>
        <br>
        <p>“Ordinary mind is the way”
        Attempting to go beyond ordinary mind and “override” the decisions of the brain/body, is the futility that creates a state of anxiety which is the cause of self-induced oppression. The mind, having become full of fear, makes a futile attempt to act outside of its own nature. A mind which is in a state of anxiety, goes seeking to gain the ability to become in control, which it cannot do, and will believe all sorts of ridiculousness as promoted by self-proclaimed authorities on the subject of self-improvement.</p>
        <p>These authorities are responsible for the propagation of fear in order to manipulate people into a state of anxiety so that they can string them along in a wild goose chase for enlightenment. Contemporary civilization is built on this form of deception and has created a global identity which does not understand its own nature. It constantly seeks to become something that it is not ever going to be. It is never satisfied, and suffers tremendous hell, regardless of its overwhelming abundance and success.</p>
        <p>Get up and Return Home, your efforts are in vain.</p>

        <h3>A quick reminder from Shunryu Suzuki</h3>
        <h3>Green Sage</h3>
        <h3>10/20/2020</h3>
        <p>Shunryu Suzuki:</p>
        <br>
        <p><i>Because Buddha was the founder of the teaching, people tentatively called his teaching &quot;Buddhism,&quot; but actually Buddhism is not some particular teaching. Buddhism, is just Truth, which includes various truths in it. Zazen practice is the practice which includes the various activities of life. So actually, we do not emphasize the sitting posture alone. How to sit is how to act. We study how to act by sitting, and this is the most basic activity for us. That is why we practice zazen in this way. Even though we practice zazen, we should not call ourselves the Zen school. We just practice zazen, taking our example from Buddha; that is why we practice. Buddha taught us how to act through our practice; that is why we sit.</i></p>
        <br>
        <p><i>To do something, to live in each moment, means to be the temporal activity of Buddha. To sit in this way is to be Buddha himself, to be as the historical Buddha was. The same thing applies to everything we do. Everything is Buddha&#39;s activity. So whatever you do, or even if you keep from doing something, Buddha is in that activity.</p>
        <p>Because people have no such understanding of Buddha, they think what they do is the most important thing, without knowing who it is that is actually doing it. People think they are doing various things, but actually Buddha is doing everything. Each one of us has his own name, but those names are the many names of one Buddha. Each one of us has many activities, but those activities are all Buddha&#39;s activities. Without knowing this, people put emphasis on some activity. When they put emphasis on zazen, it is not true zazen. It looks as if they were sitting in the same way as Buddha, but there is a big difference in their understanding of our practice. They understand this sitting posture as just one of the four basic postures of man, and they think: &quot;I now take this posture.&quot;</i></p>
        <br>
        <p><i>But zazen is all the postures, and each posture is Buddha&#39;s posture. This understanding is the right understanding of the zazen posture. If you practice in this way, it is Buddhism. This is a very, very important point.</p>
        <p>So Dogen did not call himself a Soto teacher or a Soto disciple. He said, &quot;Other people may call us the Soto school, but there is no reason for us to call ourselves Soto. You should not even use the name of Soto.&quot; No school should consider itself a separate school. It should just be one tentative form of Buddhism. But as long as the various schools do not accept this kind of understanding, as long as they continue calling themselves by their particular names, we must accept the tentative name of Soto</p>
        <p>Actually we are not the Soto school at all. We are just Buddhists. We are not even Zen Buddhists; we are just Buddhists. If we understand this point we are truly Buddhists.</i></p>
        <br>
        <ul>
        <li><i>Zen Mind, Beginner&#39;s Mind; pp. 125-127</i></li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <p>HuangBo:</p>
        <br>
        <p><i>... That there is nothing which can be attained is not idle talk; it is the truth. ...</p>
        <p>...</p>
        <p>Q: The Sixth Patriarch was illiterate. How is it that he was handed the robe which elevated him to that office? Elder Shên Hsiu (a rival candidate) occupied a position above five hundred others and, as a teaching monk, he was able to expound thirty-two volumes of Sūtras. Why did he not receive the robe?</p>
        <p>A: Because he still indulged in conceptual thought—in a dharma of activity. To him &quot;as you practice, so shall you attain&quot; was a reality. So the Fifth Patriarch made the transmission to Hui Nêng.</p>
        <p>...</p>
        <p>... All conceptual thinking is called erroneous belief. The upholders of such false doctrines delight in a multiplicity of concepts, but the Bodhisattva remains unmoved amid a whole host of them.</p>
        <p>&quot;Tathāgata&quot; means the thusness of all phenomena. Therefore it is written: &quot;Maitreya is thus; saints and sages are thus.&quot; Thusness consists in not being subject to becoming or to destruction; thusness consists in not being seen and in not being heard.</p>
        <p>The crown of the Tathāgata&#39;s head is a concept of perfection, but it is also no-perfection-to-be-conceived. So do not fall into conceiving of perfection objectively.</p>
        <p>It follows that the Buddhakāya is above all activity: therefore must you beware of discriminating between the myriads of separate forms.</i></p>
        <p>...</p>
        <br>
        <p><i>When we talk of the knowledge &quot;I&quot; may gain, the learning &quot;I&quot; may achieve, &quot;my&quot; intuitive understanding, &quot;my&quot; deliverence from rebirth, and &quot;my&quot; moral way of living, our successes make these concepts seem pleasant to us, but our failures make them appear deplorable.</p>
        <p>What is the use of all that?</p>
        <p>I advise you to remain uniformly quiescent and above all activity.</p>
        <p>Do not deceive yourselves with conceptual thinking, and do not look anywhere for the truth, for all that is needed is to refrain from allowing concepts to arise.</p>
        <p>It is obvious that mental concepts and external perceptions are equally misleading, and that the Way of the Buddhas is as dangerous to you as the way of demons.</p>
        <p>... [W]hen true understanding and ephemeral knowledge are properly integrated, it will be found that they no longer exist. There is only the One Mind, Mind which is neither Buddha nor sentient beings, for it contains no such dualism. As soon as you conceive of the Buddha, you are forced to conceive of sentient beings, or of concepts and no-concepts, of vital and trivial ones, which will surely imprison you between the two iron mountains [of dualism].</p>
        <p>On account of the obstacles created by dualistic reasoning, Bodhidharma merely pointed to the original Mind and substance of us all as being in fact the Buddha. He offered no false means of self-perfecting oneself; he belonged to no school of gradual attainment.</p>
        <p>His doctrine admits of no such attributes as light and dark.</p>
        <p>Since it is not light, lo there is no light; since it is not dark, lo there is no dark!</p>
        <p>Hence it follows that there is no Darkness, nor End of Darkness.</p>
        <p>Whosoever enters the gateway of our sect must deal with everything solely by means of the [&quot;intellect.&quot;]</i></p>
        <br>
        <p><i>This sort of perception is known as the Dharma; as the Dharma is perceived, we speak of Buddha; while perceiving that in fact there are no Dharma and no Buddha is called entering the Sangha, who are otherwise known as &quot;monks dwelling above all activity&quot;; and the whole sequence may be called the Triratna or Three Jewels in one Substance.</p>
        <p>Those who seek the Dharma must not seek from the Buddha, nor from the Dharma nor from the Sangha. They should seek from nowhere. When the Buddha is not sought, there is no Buddha to be found! When the Dharma is not sought, there is no Dharma to be found! When the Sangha is not sought, there is no Sangha!</p>
        <p>...</p>
        <p>When a sudden flash of thought occurs in your mind and you recognize it for a dream or an illusion, then you can enter into the state reached by the Buddhas of the past—not that the Buddhas of the past really exist, or that the Buddhas of the future have not yet come into existence.</p>
        <p>Above all, have no longing to become a future Buddha; your sole concern should be, as thought succeeds thought, to avoid clinging to any of them.</p>
        <p>Nor may you entertain the least ambition to be a Buddha here and now.</p>
        <p>Even if a Buddha arises, do not think of him as &quot;Enlightened&quot; or &quot;deluded&quot;, &quot;good&quot; or &quot;evil&quot;. Hasten to rid yourself of any desire to cling to him. Cut him off in the twinkling of an eye! On no account seek to hold him fast, for a thousand locks could not stay him, nor a hundred thousand feet of rope bind him. This being so, valiantly strive to banish and annihilate him.</i></p>
        <br>
        <p><i>I will now make luminously clear how to set about being rid of that Buddha.</p>
        <p>Consider the sunlight. You may say it is near, yet if you follow it from world to world you will never catch it in your hands. Then you may describe it as far away and, lo, you will see it just before your eyes.</p>
        <p>Follow it and, behold, it escapes you; run from it and it follows you close. You can neither possess it nor have done with it.</p>
        <p>From this example you can understand how it is with the true Nature of all things and, henceforth, there will be no need to grieve or to worry about such things.</p>
        <p>Now, beware of going on to say that my recommendation to cut off the Buddha was profane, or that my comparing him to the sunshine was pious, as though I had wavered from the one extreme to the other!</p>
        <p>Followers of the other sects would then agree with you, but our Zen Sect will not admit either the profanity of the first nor the pious quality of the second. Nor do we regard the first as Buddha-like, or the second as something to be expected only from ignorant sentient beings.</i></p>
        <br>
        <p>Can you spot the differences?</p>
        <p>Some suggestions:</p>
        <p>Suzuki&#39;s Buddha is a Buddha of practice and activity; for him, &quot;as you practice, so shall you attain&quot; is a reality. According to HuangBo, what does this have to do with Zen?</p>
        <p>Suzuki agrees to conceptual categories of Zen and degrees of truth to be sought in practice. HuangBo does not agree to such categorizations nor does he agree to a truth of attainment. Moreoever, what does HuangBo say about &quot;truth&quot;?</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, HuangBo is famous for having said, &quot;there are no teachers of Zen, but I didn&#39;t say there was no Zen.&quot; In contrast, Suzuki says &quot;There is no Zen (Soto) but there are teachers of Zen (Soto)&quot;; &quot;There is no Buddhism, but there are Buddhists.&quot; Is this merely &quot;identity politics&quot;?</p>
        <p>Suzuki talks about seeking out a perfected activity in order to attain the same state as &quot;the Buddha&quot;. What does HuangBo say about attaining perfection? What does HuangBo say about historical Buddhas? What does HuangBo say about the state of being a Buddha?</p>
        <p>Suzuki talks about differences in practice and differences in understanding interchangeably. How does that line up with what HuangBo says?</p>
        <p>Suzuki defines Buddhism/&quot;Soto&quot;/Zen upon common and qualitative aspects of practice. How does HuangBo define Zen?</p>

            <p>Zen is like a virus.</p>
            <p>It&#39;s hard to learn even a little bit about Zen and not be instantly curious.</p>
            <p>Even people who come here and hate Zen, and hate what the Zen Masters had to say, still pretend to speak on behalf of Zen.</p>
            <p>The &quot;Zen&quot; market brings in billions of dollars per year for many greedy (and some honest) pockets, and all the coolest Samurai and &quot;Mystical Eastern Sage&quot; stuff borrows from the legends of the Zen Masters.</p>
            <p>I mean, people even attribute the creation of Kung Fu to BodhiDharma!</p>
            <p>Not that I blame them ... just look how badass his collector&#39;s card looks!</p>
            <p>Everyone wants to be like Zen.</p>
            <p>But Zen is the honey badger of human spiritual traditions (citation necessary?)</p>
            <p>Zen doesn&#39;t care if you understand it.</p>
            <p>Zen is not subject to your whims or desires.</p>
            <p>Zen is Zen by its own defitinition.</p>
            <p>The only way to know Zen is to find out for yourself.</p>
            <p>So here we have LinJi, blabbing on about what Zen is, while also telling you--in no uncertain terms--NOT to take his word for it.</p>
            <p>But if you want to know what Zen is ... if you think BodhiDharma is so fucking badass or that this forum is full of a bunch of deluded cult-worshippers and YOU have the REAL lowdown on what Zen is ... you cannot fucking help yourself.</p>
            <p>You cannot help but go to LinJi&#39;s words and try to understand what LinJi understood ... no matter how much you may hate what he has to say.</p>
            <p>And then it&#39;s too late for you. You&#39;ve caught the virus.</p>

            The rule of the sovereign prevails throughout the land;/The general has laid to rest the dusts of battle beyond the frontiers.</i></p>
        <p><i>Again the monk asked, “What about ‘to take away both person and surroundings’?”

            The master said:
            
            No news from Bing and Fen,/Isolated and away from everywhere.</i></p>
        <p><i>The monk asked, “What about ‘to take away neither person nor the surroundings’?”

            The master said:
            
            The sovereign ascends into the jeweled palace;/Aged rustics sing songs.</i></p>
        <br>
        <p>Going to the West, we find the Buddha-eye of the Indian Patriachs./Where is there dust, if no mirror?/Naturally moving, without concepts,/the world is a jewel.</p>
        <p>Going to the East, the body is perfected;/the mountain paths are chanced, the Pure Lands swept clean./What use is there polishing a tile into a mirror?/Removing distractions, liberation of will is achieved, and peace follows.</p>
        <p>Going to the North, we find the wooden blocks of silent illumination,/undisturbed by the possibility of reflection./Though war may threaten at the gates, how is one to see over a 1000 mile wall?/Rest reigns supreme, and all cares are dislodged.</p>
        <p>Following Deshan to the South, dust and jewels are found everywhere one turns./What extra thing can be discovered?/The Master finds their home, and the Layman makes a joke,/never asking for more.</p>
        <br>
        <p><b>With brutal clarity, Linji lays the entire thing at our feet:</b></p>
        <br>
        <p><i>Then the master said, “Nowadays, he who studies buddhadharma must seek true insight. Gaining true insight, he is not affected by birth-and-death, but freely goes or stays. He needn’t seek the excellent—that which is excellent will come of itself.

            “Followers of the Way, our eminent predecessors from of old have all had their ways of saving people. As for me, what I want to make clear to you is that you must not accept the deluded views of others. If you want to act, then act. Don’t hesitate.
            
            “Students today can’t get anywhere. What ails you? Lack of faith in yourself is what ails you. If you lack faith in yourself, you’ll keep on tumbling along, following in bewilderment aft er all kinds of circumstances and being taken by them through transformation after transformation without ever attaining freedom.
            
            “Bring to rest the thoughts of the ceaselessly seeking mind, and you will not differ from the patriarch-buddha. Do you want to know the patriarch-buddha? He is none other than you who stand before me listening to my discourse. But because you students lack faith in yourselves, you run around seeking something outside. Even if, through your seeking, you did find something, that something would be nothing more than fancy descriptions in written words; never would you gain the mind of the living patriarch. Make no mistake, worthy Chan men! If you don’t find it here and now, you’ll go on transmigrating through the three realms for myriads of kalpas and thousands of lives, and, held in the clutch of captivating circumstances, be born in the wombs of asses or cows."</i></p>

        <h3><u>Te Shan Carrying His Bundle</u></h3>
        <h3>Surupamaerl</h3>
        <h3>10/16/2020</h3>
        <h4>Blue Cliff Record: Case IV</h4>
        <p><i>When Te Shan arrived at Kuei Shan, he carried his bundle with him into the teaching hall, where he crossed from east to west and from west to east. He looked around and said, "There's nothing, no one." Then he went out.

            Hsueh Tou added the comment, "Completely exposed." But when Te Shan got to the monastery gate, he said, "Still, I shouldn't be so coarse." So he reentered (the hall) with full ceremony to meet (Kuei Shan). As Kuei Shan sat there, Te Shan held up his sitting mat and said, "Teacher!" Kuei Shan reached for his whisk, whereupon Te Shan shouted, shook out his sleeves, and left.
            
            Hsueh Tou added the comment, "Completely exposed."
            
            Te Shan turned his back on the teaching hall, put on his straw sandals, and departed. That evening Kuei Shan asked the head monk, "Where is that newcomer who just came?" The head monk answered, "At that time he turned his back on the teaching hall, put on his straw sandals, and departed."
            
            Kuei Shan said, "Hereafter that lad will go to the summit of a solitary peak, build himself a grass hut, and go on scolding the Buddhas and reviling the Patriarchs."
            
            Hsueh Tou added the comment, "He adds frost to snow."</i></p>
        <br>
        <p>Teshan knows how to look like a fool while being a complete badass. Yuanwu calls them "the board-carrying fellow [someone whose vision being obstructed by the burden], the wild fox spirit! [someone who guilty of being clever]" Teshan walks in, walks around in some symbolic way, and says, "There's nothing, no one" and leaves. Yuanwu comments:</p>
        <br>
        <p><i>He deserves thirty blows of the staff. Indeed his spirit reaches the heavens. A real lion cub can roar the lion's roar.</i></p>
        <br>
        <p>But Yuanwu also says:</p>
        <br>
        <p><i>Wasn't he crazy?...See how extraordinary that Te Shan was; this is why it is said, "To stand out from the crowd, you must be a brave spirited fellow; to defeat enemies is a matter for a lion's son. If you try to become Buddha without an eye like this, how will you ever do it, even in a thousand years?"</i></p>
        <br>
        <p>What are we to make of this foolish courage?</p>
        <p>Yuanwu comments on the Kuei Shan:</p>
        <br>
        <p><i>This old fellow Kuei Shan still was not taken in by that (Te Shan) anyone but Kuei Shan would have been crushed by him. Look at how the old adept Kuei Shan meets him; he just sits there and observes the outcome. If he did not profoundly discern the 'oncoming wind,' how could he have been like this?</i></p>
        <br>
        <p>The old man is settled and steady. Afterwards, Teshan thinks to reform his idiotic behaviour, and challenges Kuei Shan to be his teacher, and Kuei Shan accepts! Bluff called, Teshan is exposed for a foolish lion cub, and Kuei Shan is exposed for an old bear. Teshan runs out of there, shaking their sleeves and shouting like a Zen Master and thinking they are being clever. Yuanwu calls them outstanding.</p>
        <br>
        <p><i>Kuei Shan was not flustered at all. This is why it is said, "One whose wisdom surpasses a bird's can catch a bird, one whose wisdom surpasses an animal's can catch an animal, and one whose wisdom surpasses a man's can catch a man." When one is immersed in this kind of Ch'an, even if the multitude of appearances and myriad forms, heavens and hells, and all the plants, animals, and people, all were to shout at once, he still wouldn't be bothered; even if someone overthrew his meditation seat and scattered his congregation with shouts, he wouldn't give it any notice.</i></p>
        <br>
        <p>Every Xuedou's "Completely exposed" is met with Yuanwu's "Wrong. After all. Check!" Yuanwu wants us to see what they see; an idiot pretending to be a Zen Master, but also firebrand with the courage to pull down golden Buddha's from where they sit and shatter them across the grass. This is why their comment on Teshan's decision to go out and destroy the Zen devils in the south is "You see from how aroused he got, what a fierce, keen fellow he was."</p>
        <p>"He adds frost to snow" can now be taken in two ways. Do you see?</p>
        <br>
        <h4>Verse</h4>
        <p><i>One "completely exposed"/"Adding frost to snow" -(Te Shan) has had a dangerous fall./The General of the Flying Cavalry enters the enemy camp;/How many could regain their safety?/(Te Shan) hurriedly runs past-/(But Kuei Shan) doesn't let him go./On the summit of the solitary peak, he sits among the weeds;/Bah!</i></p>
        <br>
        <p>Yuanwu says "It is easy to distinguish dragons from snakes; it is hard to fool a patchrobed monk." I am going to let them speak at length because it is truly outstanding.</p>
        <p>The first three lines refer to famous Archer who was boldly captured, and boldly escaped. Yuanwu explains:</p>
        <br>
        <p><i>This fellow had the ability to wrest life from the midst of death; Hsueh Tou alludes to this in the verse to make a comparison with Te Shan, who re-entered (the teaching hall) to meet (Kuei Shan), and was able to leap out again, as before.

            Look at how that Ancient (Te Shan) sees all the way, speaks all the way, acts all the way, and functions all the way; he's undeniably a brave spirit. Only if you possess the ability to kill a man without blinking an eye can you then become Buddha right where you stand. Someone who can fulfill Buddhahood right where he stands naturally kills people without blinking an eye; thus he has his share of freedom and independence.</i></p>
        <br>
        <p>I see this in myself and am afraid; of what I might lose; of the damage I might cause. Teshan is braver than I. At least I am not wild fox spirit.</p>
        <br>
        <p><i>When some people these days are questioned, at first they seem to have the qualities of a patchrobed monk, but when they're pressed even slightly, their waists snap and their legs break; they come all to pieces. They totally lack the slightest continuity. That is why an Ancient said, "Continuity is indeed very difficult." Look at how Te Shan and Kuei Shan acted; were theirs stammering, halting views?</i></p>
        <br>
        <p>This I find easier to practice. Still a work in progress, but less concepts to cut up. I've heard of ZMs having continuity for decades.</p>
        <br>
        <p><i>At this point, why does Hsueh Tau say, "On the summit of the solitary peak, he sits among the weeds," and then add an exclamation? Tell me, what does this come down to? Study for thirty more years!</i></p>
        <br>
        <p>"He adds frost to snow" can now be taken in two ways. Do you see?! Speak! If you can't, you're already dead!</p>

        <h3><u>TRUST IN HEART-MIND (Jungle_Toad Remix)</u></h3>
        <h3>Jungle Toad</h3>
        <h3>8/22/2020</h3>
        <h4>Introduction:</h4>
        <p>So, I decided to do my own interpretation of the 3rd Patriarch's (Seng Ts'an's) famous poem, the Hsin Hsin Ming (aka Faith in Mind Inscription, aka Trust in Heart-Mind, aka Song of Enlightenment, etc.). My version is written to sound like a surfer dude. Why did I do this? I don't know. I thought it would be funny, and I thought it would be a good exercise for myself to study the various versions of the poem and try to put the phrases in everyday language, so I could better understand it. Because discussions about zen are inherently contradictory and confusing, it is naturally esoteric. Nevertheless, it is fundamentally not meant to be elitist. This is one of the things I love about zen. It's for everyone, even if not everyone understands it. I had that in mind while working on this project. I hope you have fun with it, as I did in making it.</p>
        <p>There are many translations available out there. I based my remix largely on Blyth's, Cleary's, Waley's, and Wonderwheel's. I had a bunch of tabs open while trying to figure out how to phrase each line.</p>
        <p><i>Original poem (Hsin Hsin Ming) by Seng Ts’an, the 3rd Zen Patriarch</i></p>
        <h4>Jungle Toad Remix:</h4>
        <p>The Supreme Way is like not even hard.

            Just stop being a fussmuppet, wanting everything your own way.
            
            Don’t obsess about shit. Don’t hate shit.
            
            Then you’ll start to grok it.
            
            …</p>
        <p>If you’re like a smidge off though… Dayumn!

            Bruh, you get totally pitted!
            
            If you’re gonna surf that shit right, homie,
            
            Just don’t be anti all the time… but like, don’t be a fanboy/fangirl either
            
            …</p>
        <p>Bitching about what you want and what you don’t,

            That’s just stupid ass head games you play in your own mind.
            
            If you keep pushing to figure out what’s up,
            
            Then there’s no point in even trying to get yourself to be chill.
            
            …</p>
        <p>When you really know what’s up, it’s like this cosmic space thing.

            You don’t need stuff because you already have all you need.
            
            For reals! It’s only cuz you’re like “Yay! I want this!” or “Wah! I don’t like that!”,
            
            That you don’t see what I’m talking about.
            
            …</p>
        <p>Don’t try to force the vibes to happen,

            But don’t just zone out like some crackhead either.
            
            Just be mellow and don’t worry too much about it.
            
            It’s cool. Shit just kind of sorts itself out
            
            …</p>
        <p>When you hit the brakes and come to full stop,

            Then you’re “driving” by idling.
            
            If you only use the gas pedal or only use the brakes,
            
            Then you don’t know what you’re doing behind the wheel, dufus! Ha ha!
            
            …</p>
        <p>All this shit goes together.

            If you’re all about just doing shit, or just not doing shit: Epic fail!
            
            If you try to bail on everything, then you’re not keepin it real either.
            
            If you’re too open minded,
            
            Your brain falls out and you’re a straight up vegetable!
            
            …</p>
        <p>When you talk too much and think too much,

            It’s obvious to everyone you don’t know what you’re talking about.
            
            Just stop talking for once in your life and clear your head,
            
            You’ll figure shit out.
            
            …</p>
        <p>If you keep to the true core, you get the basic gist,

            But if you only go for appearances, you’re a total poser.
            
            If you know what it’s like to be cool inside yourself,
            
            Everything else that’s not that, is obviously fake, but still there.
            
            …</p>
        <p>All the wannabes and posers with their fake shit,

            Are only like that because they’re ignorant and clearly don’t get it.
            
            Trying to be cool is not cool. Trying to be real is not being real.
            
            …</p>
        <p>Be fierce about avoiding labels and not being a follower.

            If you try to be like someone else or something else,
            
            You’re just gonna suck because you’re trying to be something you’re not.
            
            …</p>
        <p>Things are all part of the big picture,

            But don’t get hooked on the big picture.
            
            When you’re cool with it and don’t think too much about it,
            
            Everything happens for a reason and it’s nobody’s fault.
            
            …</p>
        <p>If you don’t blame things for existing, then it’s sorta like they’re not even there.

            It’s not a thing. You’re cool with it. It is what it is. You don’t mind.
            
            When you see everything’s basically just some shit that doesn’t matter, your mind chills out.
            
            When your own mind says “peace out” and disappears, everything dips out.
            
            …</p>
        <p>You see stuff as a bunch of different things because your mind chunks it up.

            Your mind evolved to see stuff because there are a bunch of things to see.
            
            When you try to figure out what’s real and what’s your mind,
            
            You come up empty on understanding both your mind and all the stuff.
            
            …</p>
        <p>In that emptiness though, it’s all kind of the same.

            Everything you are and all you can see is all wrapped up in emptiness.
            
            If you see yourself as that emptiness and take the rough with the smooth,
            
            How can you even be for or against anything?
            
            …</p>
        <p>The millions of ways you can kick it in the Supreme Way are massive,

            It’s not just laid back and it’s not just a struggle.
            
            But if you’re smallminded or a square, you’re probably too chicken-shit to do it.
            
            Plus, the more you try to rush it, the longer it’s gonna take you.
            
            …</p>
        <p>If you’re hooked on being Mr. HotShitCoolDude, you’ll lose balance and turf it.

            You’ll start believing your own bullshit or get duped and thrown off.
            
            Just let go. You do you, and let everything else take its own course.
            
            There’s nowhere you need to bounce to, no one else you need to be. You got this!
            
            …</p>
        <p>Just be natural, because everything on Earth is natural.

            Flow with it freely and you’ll be in the zone.
            
            Don’t get hung up on some idea of how things should be (but aren’t).
            
            Don’t tune it all out and go dark either. You’ll get sunk!
            
            …</p>
        <p>It’s stupid to rage against the world. You just create your own headfuck.

            What’s the point of trying to line up all your likes and dislikes?
            
            You only live once!
            
            All your experiences, good or bad, are all part of life.
            
            …</p>
        <p>Experience, man! That’s what I’m talkin about!

            Feel it all! That’s the real deal!
            
            Someone wise to it wouldn’t try to change anything.
            
            Only a crazy dipshit would keep trying to do the same shit over and over.
            
            …</p>
        <p>There are no special things.

            “Special” is like, just your opinion, man!
            
            If you try to use your head to figure out what’s in your own head…
            
            Uh… DUH! Good luck with that… Ha ha!
            
            …</p>
        <p>If your head’s not on straight, you’ll be all “peace & love” one minute, and full-on aggro the next.

            When you finally see the light, you don’t need things to be any special way.
            
            When you always have opposites fighting against each other in your mind,
            
            You’re just making up problems in your head to drive yourself crazy
            
            …</p>
        <p>Hopes and dreams? Flowery imagined fantasies?

            Why do you only ever seem to want whatever it is you don’t have?
            
            Obsessing over getting things, or losing things; stressing over what’s right, or what’s wrong,
            
            Fuck it. Fuck all of it.
            
            …</p>
        <p>When you see shit for what it is, the eye never sleeps.

            No more living in a dream!
            
            If you stop with all the judgment and just let go,
            
            Everything is as it should be.
            
            …</p>
        <p>The universe is mysterious. It. Just. Is. Seriously, it’s OK.

            Did you honestly think you, me, or some Einstein would be the first person to finally figure it all out? Ha ha.
            
            Dude, don’t make me laugh my freakin’ ass off! We’re all just doing our best to get by.
            
            We all grew out of one nature, but act like we don’t know how to be natural. I guess we just forget, or are being stupid or something.
            
            …</p>
        <p>The whole shebang can’t be compared to some other thing because it’s all there is.

            If you need to take a rest, then you must have been busy.
            
            If you need to get busy, then you must have been resting.
            
            Pairs always go together. When you stop resting and stop being busy,

            When you get your mind on lock with this unity,

        <p>This is the space of the really real.

            There is no you and there is nobody other than you.
            
            If you want to get there with a quickness,

            …</p>
        <p>This One truth can’t be any bigger or any smaller,

            Whether for just a second or a million years; it’s all the same difference.
            
            It’s not near or far, cuz there’s nowhere it is not.

            Limits are just self-imposed. No limit.
            
            The infinitely huge stuff is just as small as the microscopic stuff;

            Whatever isn’t, is.

            Not splitting in two, is about trusting in your heart-mind.

        <p><i>Someone asked Yunmen, “What is the essence of a patch-robed monk?”

            The Master said, “It’s your turn!”
            
            The questioner insisted, “Please, Master, tell me!”
            
            The Master said, “I’m playing the harp for an ox!”</i></p>
        <p>.....</p>
        <p>Is it your turn to sing in the round yet?

            Yunmen answered the question the first time it was asked, but the monk is not in accord with the tune, so he misses the beautiful melody. But how can he get in accord with the music of his very own essence? Can anyone play him a song that will open his ears to his own heart?
            
            .....</p>

        <p><i>A long time ago in China there were two friends, one who played the harp skillfully and one who listened skillfully.

            When the one played or sang about a mountain, the other would say: ‘I can see the mountain before us.’ When the one played about water, the listener would exclaim: ‘Here is the running stream!’
            
            But the listener fell sick and died. The first friend cut the strings of his harp and never played again. Since that time the cutting of harp strings has always been a sign of intimate friendship.</i></p>

        <h3><u>Metacommunication with Bodhidharma and playing Rock Paper Scissors with the Zen Masters.</u></h3>
        <h3>Jungle Toad</h3>
        <h3>7/28/2020</h3>
        <p>“I always lie” or stated for better logical formalism “This statement is a lie.” This is the classic Liar’s Paradox, also called the Epimenides Paradox because Epimenides, a Cretan, famously said “All Cretans are liars!” If the statement is true, then it must be a lie, but if it’s false, then it must be true. How does one resolve it? There are multiple philosophical arguments for how to resolve the paradox, but the one I want to discuss is ‘metacommunication’ because I think it is helpful in understanding zen masters.</p>
        <br>
        <p>If you think of the phrase “This statement is a lie” as a metacommunication (a communication about a communication) then you can make some sense of the statement. If everything I say actually is a lie, then there still has to be the possibility for truth, I just don’t speak it. So, if I shift the conversation to the higher meta level, then I can transcend the truths and lies by simply making a metastatement that “I always lie” and then that can be true about all my non-meta communications. It’s sort of a “free pass” because it comes from a transcended level where truth and lies are both always possible and not possible (empty), even if, in the particular communications, they are always lies.</p>
        <br>
        <p><b>What does this have to do with Bodhidharma and Zen?</b></p>
        <br>
        <p>From Bodhidharma onward, the zen masters commonly make jumps to transcended meta-levels and it can be difficult to understand them if you don’t realize they are doing this. Let’s look at some examples of this. First, let’s take the Mahayana (‘great vehicle’ or ‘great raft’) Buddhist metaphor of enlightenment being like “going to the other shore.” Bodhidharma crosses the other shore by leaving both shores for the meta-level.</p>
        <br>
        <p><i>“When you're deluded, this shore exists. When you wake up, it doesn't exist. Mortals stay on this shore. But those who discover the greatest of all vehicles stay on neither this shore nor the other shore. They're able to leave both shores. Those who see the other shore as different from this shore don't understand zen.”</i></p>
        <p>-from Bodhidharma’s Wake-Up Sermon</p>
        <br>
        <p>So you see, mortals can’t cross the other shore because they are deluded in believing that there is another shore in the first place and that they don’t have access to. But “the greatest vehicle” leads you to abide in neither shore, similar to how the meta explanation for the Epimenides Paradox allows a metacommunication outside of ‘truth or lie’ to communicate about the ordinary communications of Cretans, all of which are lies.</p>
        <br>
        <p>And when Bodhidharma speaks of this “greatest vehicle” he collapses the Three Vehicles of Buddhism (Mahayana, Hinayana, Tantrayana) into One Greatest Vehicle: Mind. He explicitly states this elsewhere and reminds us that the sutras say that “No vehicle is the vehicle of the Buddhas”, but I think he most clearly explains it in the following paragraph:</p>
        <br>
        <p><i>“Whoever knows that the mind is a fiction and devoid of anything real knows that his own mind neither exists nor doesn't exist. Mortals keep creating the mind, claiming it exists. And arhats keep negating the mind, claiming it doesn't exist. But bodhisattvas and buddhas neither create nor negate the mind. This is what's meant by the mind that neither exists nor doesn't exist. The mind that neither exists nor doesn't exist is called the Middle Way.”</i></p>
        <p>-from Bodhidharma’s ‘Wake Up Sermon’</p>
        <br>
        <p>Again, at the meta-level there is ‘mind’ and ‘no mind’, there is ‘buddha’ and ‘no buddha’. You can’t seek mind with mind, because mind needs to classify, condense, and encode. Mind cannot condense and encode itself, and so classification no longer makes sense other than in considering all that one is doing (and not doing) as Mind. Yet, there is this really fascinating dialectic here between realism and solipsism/nihilism. Everything you have ever experienced in your life has all been experienced in your mind. You’ve never experienced anything real (or fake) because it has all been condensed information encoded into your senses or your thoughts. None of it is reality. And yet, the only real thing you know without question is that you are consciously experiencing the world. You only experience reality inside the brain inside your skull, yet that consciousness inside your brain and skull exists in reality. They fold in on each other. This is the Middle Way, as Bodhidharma is explaining it. It’s not about balancing between this and that. It is residing right there in that zone where the real and illusory are all the same source, which is everywhere (and nowhere)</p>
        <br>
        <p>Now that we have discussed the dialectic between realism and solipsism/nihilism, and the meta level of this view of the Middle Way, I want to discuss what I call playing Rock, Paper, Scissors with the zen masters. This is currently a hypothesis I am playing with, so take it with a huge grain of salt, but many Buddhist terms come in threes, which I will call tri-concepts which I think guide a lot of zen conversational maneuvers. Many of the threes connect point-by-point to other threes. As a refresher, here are some of the main Buddhist tri-concepts (I have included in parentheses next to each tri-concept how I think it relates to the other tri-concepts).</p>
        <br>
        <p><b>Three Realms:</b>Desire Realm, Form Realm, Formless Realm</p>
        <br>
        <p><b>Three Poisons:</b>(generated in the three realms): Greed, Anger, Delusion</p>
        <br>
        <p><b>Threefold Way:</b>(ways out of the three poisons): Morality, Meditation, Wisdom (this is a condensed version of the eightfold path, which Bodhidharam mentions only very briefly in the Bloodstream Sermon)</p>
        <br>
        <p><b>Three Vehicles:</b>Three Vehicles (to travel out of the three realms): Tantrayana, Hinayana, Mahayana</p>
        <br>
        <p><b>Three Buddha Bodies:</b>(are arrived at by the three vehicles): dharmakaya (reality body or truth body), sambhogakaya (bliss body or reward body), nirmanakaya (emanation body or physical body)</p>
        <br>
        <p>Here is a quote from Bodhidharma linking the Three Poisons to the Three Realms:</p>
        <br>
        <p><i>“An uninhabited place is one without greed, anger, or delusion. Greed is the realm of desire, anger the realm of form, and delusion the formless realm. When a thought begins, you enter the three realms. When a thought ends, you leave the three realms.”</i></p>
        <p>-from Bodhidharma’s ‘Wake Up Sermon’</p>
        <br>
        <p>Notice he distinguishes the 3 realms, distinguishes the 3 poisons, associates the 3 realms with the 3 poisons, and also leaves them all when a thought ends. Red Pine’s footnotes explain that “an uninhabited place” is a place where one becomes enlightened, and is sometimes used to refer to a zen monastery (though presumably it could be anywhere). In this way, it’s similar to the meta-level I discussed earlier; beyond the threes. I think zen masters will sometimes illicit the tri-concepts while trying to push you beyond the tri-concepts, and they do so in a sort-of Rock/Paper/Scissors fashion where if you communicate that you are too attached to the form realm, they highlight something spiritual you desire from the desire realm; or they communicate about the formless to shock and surprise you away from forms. If you become too detached in the formless realm, they hit you with some emotionally evocative poetry from the realm of desire; or smack you with a staff to whack you back to the realm of form. If you communicate that you are suffering while being awash with emotional cravings and desires, they demonstrate that the most sublime is found in the concrete and ordinary from the realm of form (like Buddha is 3 pounds of flax); or they lead you to the formless realm where everything is neither good or bad. All of this is not just to shove you around the 3 realms though, because you need to hit the meta-level as well. Mind beats form, formless, and desire realms.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Yuanwu sometimes speaks of “In raising one, he illuminates three; In raising three, he illuminates one.” I visualize this as raising the corner of a sheet of paper. The meta-level is the whole paper, but if you raise the paper by a corner, you see the other 3 corners. Enough of this and you start to recognize the whole paper from the relationship of the corners, then realize they are all of one piece, though the corners can be differentiated. Yuanwu (and other zen masters) also use lots of other related phrases like folding out and folding in, or rolling out and rolling in, knowing where it will land after it has been brought up. This all seems to me, to in some way be relating the particulars to the universal, and vice verse. By condensing the varied tangible world into the one primal source, you can travel easily (in one vehicle: Mind) between the tangible and the source.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Yunmen is particularly adept at playing the rock, paper, scissors game. Take this passage from Yuanwu, who describes how Yunmen plays the game:</p>
        <br>
        <p><i>“You must understand how Yun Men raises one and illuminates three, raises three and illuminates one. If you go to his three phrases to seek, then you're pulling an arrow out of the back of your head. In a single phrase of Yun Men's, three phrases are inevitably present: the phrase that contains heaven and earth, the phrase that follows the waves and pursues the currents, and the phrase that cuts off the myriad streams. (What he says) is naturally exactly appropriate. But tell me, of the three phrases, which one does Yun Men use to receive people?”</i></p>
        <p>-Yuanwu in commentary to Blue Cliff Record: Case #27 ‘Yun Men’s Body Exposed, The Golden Wind’</p>
        <br>
        <p>In my view, “the phrase that contains heaven and earth” relates to the realm of desire, “the phrase that follows the waves and pursues the currents” relates to the realm of form, and “the phrase that cuts off the myriad streams” relates to the realm of the formless… however, I do recognize that I am putting square Buddhist pegs into round Zen holes here. I think you should take the words as they are because Zen masters are operating from that transcended meta-level, where any of the constituent parts need to be understood differently as existing only in Mind/No Mind, thus still being somewhat illusory, yet translatable to the real world. Yunmen never loses site of any of this, and is very adept at allowing the contradictions to co-exist without losing the ability to discern them. Notice, however, when you read koans how readily you can see zen masters confronting one corner of a tri-concept with another, while not forgetting the big picture. I think it will aid in your study. Yunmen spells it out for us:</p>
        <br>
        <p><i>The Master one day held up his staff and mentioned a teaching that goes:

            The ordinary person in all sincerity says that this [staff] exists, [representatives of] the two vehicles of Buddhist teaching explain that it doesn't exist, the pratyeka buddhas say it exists as an illusion, and the bodhisattvas empty it as it is.
            
            Then Master Yunmen said, "When a patch-robed monk sees this staff, he just calls it a staff; when he walks, he just walks; and when he sits, he just sits. In all of this he cannot be stirred."</i></p>
        <p>-from Zen Master Yunmen, translated by Urs App</p>
        <br>
        <p>To understand all of this intellectually, as I am trying to do in this post, is ultimately a losing game. The One-Mind is only understood tacitly beyond the written word. Just remember that I started this long-winded post with the phrase “I always lie.”</p>
        <br>
        <p>One last case to end on as I contemplate the meaning of 3x3 sets:</p>
        <br>
        <p><i>Manjusri asked Wu Cho, "Where have you just come from?" Wu Cho said, "The South." Manjusri said, "How is the Buddhist Teaching being carried on in the South?" Wu Cho said, "Monks of the Last Age have little regard for the rules of discipline." Manjusri said, "How numerous are the congregations?" Wu Cho said, "Some three hundred, some five hundred." Wu Cho asked Manjusri, "How is it being carried on hereabouts?" Manjusri said, "Ordinary people and sages dwell together; dragons and snakes intermingle." Wu Cho said, "How numerous are the congregations?" Manjusri said, "In front, three by three; in back, three by three."</i></p>

        <p><i>If you cannot tell deluding from enlightening influences, then you have left one home [ordinary life] only to enter another home [cultish religious allegiances]. Then you are called a sentient being creating karma, not a true leaver of home.</i></p>
        <br>
        <p><i>Right now there’s something where enlightenment and delusion share the same substance undivided.</i></p>
        <br>
        <p><i>It’s like water and milk mixed together: the king goose drinks only the milk.</i></p>

        <h3><i>People of the Path with clear eyes will reject both delusion and enlightenment.</i></h3>
        <br>
        <h3><i>If you love holy things and hate ordinary things, you float and sink in the sea of birth and death.</i></h3>
        <br>
        <p><i>Someone asked: “What are enlightenment and delusion?”</i></p>
        <br>
        <p><i>Linji said: A moment when your mind is in doubt is delusion. If you can comprehend that the myriad phenomena are unborn, that [deluded] mind is like an illusory transformation, so that you are everywhere pure, this is enlightenment. So enlightenment and delusion are the two objects, "defilement" and "purity".</i></p>
        <br>
        <p><i>In my view, there are no buddhas and no sentient beings, no ancient and no modern.</i></p>
        <br>
        <p><i>Those who attain, attain without cultivation, without realization, without gain, and without loss, for them there is never anything else but reality.</i></p>
        <br>
        <p><i>Even if there is anything that goes beyond this, I would say that it is like a dream or a magical illusion.</i></p>
        <br>
        <p><i>This is what I am saying.</i></p>

        <p><i>(From the Recorded Sayings of Linji; Combination of translations by R. Sasaki and T. Cleary)</i></p>
        <br>
        <p><i>One day Linji was sitting with [two monks named] Heyang and Muta by the stove in the monks’ hall. They were talking about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puhua">[Puhua]</a>, who was in the marketplace every day capering around acting crazy, and wondering whether he was an ordinary man or a sage.</i></p>
        <br>
        <p><i>Before their talk finished, Puhua happened to come in, so Linji asked him, "Are you an ordinary man or a sage?"</i></p>
        <br>
        <p><i>Puhua said, "You tell me, am I an ordinary man or a sage?"</i></p>
        <br>
        <p><i>Linji then shouted.</i></p>
        <br>
        <p><i>Puhua pointed to them and said, "Heyang is a new bride, Muta is an old lady! Linji is a little pisser, but he has the eye!"</i></p>
        <br>
        <p><i>Linji exclaimed, "You thief!"</i></p>
        <br>
        <p><i>Puhua cried, "Thief! Thief!" and went out.</i></p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p><i>One day Puhua was in front of the monks' hall, eating some raw vegetables.</i></p>
        <br>
        <p><i>Linji saw him and said, "Just like a donkey."</i></p>
        <br>
        <p><i>"Heehaw, heehaw!" brayed Puhua.</i></p>
        <br>
        <p><i>Linji said, "You thief!"</i></p>
        <br>
        <p><i>Puhua cried, "Thief! Thief!" and went out.
        </i></p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p><i>Every day in the marketplace Puhua would ring a small bell and say,</i></p>
        <br>
        <p><i>"If you come in light, I hit you in light."</i></p>
        <br>
        <p><i>"If you come in darkness, I hit you in darkness."</i></p>
        <br>
        <p><i>"If you come from the four quarters and eight directions, I hit you like a whirlwind."</i></p>
        <br>
        <p><i>"If you come from emptiness, I lash you like a flail."</i></p>
        <br>
        <p><i>Linji sent his attendant [with instructions] to hold Puhua fast as soon as he saw him talk like this and say, "If I don't come in any of these ways, then what?"</i></p>
        <br>
        <p><i>[When the attendant did this] Puhua pushed him away and said, "Tomorrow there’s a feast at Dabei Yuan; the Temple of Great Compassion."</i></p>
        <br>
        <p><i>The attendant returned and related this to Linji.</i></p>

        <p><i>These days there are many public teachers whose guiding eye is not clear. How wrong this is!</i></p>
        <br>
        <p><i>How dare they mount a pulpit to try to help others?!</i></p>
        <br>

        <br>
        <p><i>If you have any kind of a clue at all, you should not let yourself be set up as a teacher as long as you are not enlightened, because to do so is an absolute travesty!</i></p>
        <br>
        <p><i>If there is something real in you, "musk is naturally fragrant" they say.</i></p>
        <br>
        <p><i>Do you understand this?</i></p>
        <br>
        <h3><i>Just look how many phony "Zen Masters" there are, degenerating away each and every day. They are like human feces carved into wooden icons; in the end, all you're left with is the smell of shit!</i></h3>

        <p><i>Wishing to get out of birth and death, wishing to attain release, you try to become unified; but one does not attain unification after becoming homogenized. If you try to make yourself unified, you will certainly not attain unification.</i></p>

        <p><i>There's a story about a seeker who called on a Wayfarer and asked, as they roamed the mountains, "An ancient teacher said he sought unification for thirty years without being able to attain it; what does this mean?"</i></p>
        <br>
        <p><i>The Wayfarer replied, "I too am thus."</i></p>
        <br>
        <p><i>Then he asked the seeker, "Understand?"</i></p>
        <br>
        <p><i>He also gave the seeker a poem:</i></p>

        <p><i><b>The ancient teacher attains unification</b></i></p>
        <p><i><b>And I too am thus;</b></i></p>

        <p><i>(Foyan, T. Cleary translation, Instant Zen ("Independence"))</i></p>
        <br>
        <p><i>What do you people come to me for?</i></p>
        <br>
        <p><i>Each individual should lead life autonomously—don’t listen to what other people say.</i></p>
        <br>
        <p><i>An ancient declared, “I knew how to lead life by the time I was eighteen.”</i></p>
        <br>
        <p><i>You people must learn to live independently.</i></p>
        <br>
        <p><i>You say, “Lead what life?”</i></p>
        <br>
        <p><i>Just do not seek elsewhere.</i></p>
        <br>
        <p><i>Most people today are compulsively active; this is already not knowing how to lead life. This is called abandoning home, scattering the family, and becoming a drifter. Clearly this is not understanding.</i></p>
        <br>
        <p><i>Just searching and seeking, studying a bit of intellectual knowledge, memorizing a few sayings, is called “hauling manure inside.”</i></p>
        <br>
        <p><i>When you get here, your actions have to be truly accurate; eventually it will sink in thoroughly, and then you will understand.</i></p>
        <br>
        <h3><i>An ancient said, “Everywhere is you. Go east, and it’s you; go west, and it’s you. Who are you?”</i></h3>
        <br>
        <p><i>If you say, “Me,” this is emotional and intellectual consciousness, which you must pass through before you attain realization.</i></p>
        <br>
        <p><i>In ancient times Vasubandhu asked Asanga, “Elder brother, when you went to the inner palace, what teaching did Maitreya expound to you?”</i></p>
        <br>
        <p><i>Asanga replied, “He expounded this teaching.”</i></p>
        <br>
        <p><i>Now tell me, what teaching is this?</i></p>
        <br>
        <p><i>You must be able to discern it before you can realize it.</i></p>
        <br>
        <p><i>Don’t fix recognition on "this". Many people have been fooled by the term "this".</i></p>
        <br>
        <p><i>That is why they speak of illness as if it were medicine.</i></p>
        <br>
        <p><i>Therefore we say they are pitiful.</i></p>

        <h3>Green Sage</h3>
        <h3>4/19/2020</h3>
        <p>This OP is intended for anyone wondering what Buddhist scriptures, sutras, chanting, mediation, and other various practices have to do with Zen and what the Zen Masters (or at least, Huangbo but ... well that's another conversation) had to say about the whole thing.</p>
        <br>
        <h3>HuangBo</h3>
        <br>
        <p><i>(J. Blofeld translaton)</i></p>
        <br>
        <p><i><b>As to performing the six pāramitās and vast numbers of similar practices, or gaining merits as countless as the sands of the Ganges, since you are fundamentally complete in every respect, you should not try to supplement that perfection by such meaningless practices.</b> When there is occasion for them, perform them; and, when the occasion is passed, remain quiescent.</i></p>
        <br>
        <p><i><b>If you are not absolutely convinced that the Mind is the Buddha, and if you are attached to forms, practices and meritorious performances, your way of thinking is false and quite incompatible with the Way.</b></i></p>
        <br>
        <p><i>The Mind is the Buddha, nor are there any other Buddhas or any other mind. It is bright and spotless as the void, having no form or appearance whatever.</i></p>
        <br>
        <p><i>To make use of your minds to think conceptually is to leave the substance and attach yourselves to form. The Ever-Existent Buddha is not a Buddha of form or attachment.</i></p>
        <br>
        <p><i><b>To practice the six pāramitās and a myriad similar practices with the intention of becoming a Buddha thereby is to advance by stages, but the Ever-Existent Buddha is not a Buddha of stages.</b></i></p>
        <br>
        <p><i>Only awake to the One Mind, and <b>there is nothing whatsoever to be attained.</b> This is the real Buddha.</i></p>
        <br>
        <p><i>The Buddha and all sentient beings are the One Mind and nothing else.</i></p>
        <br>
        <p><i>Mind is like the void in which there is no confusion or evil; as when the sun wheels through [the emptiness of the sky] shining upon the four corners of the world. For, when the sun rises and illuminates the whole earth, the void gains not in brilliance; and, when the sun sets, the void does not darken.</i></p>
        <br>
        <p><i>The phenomena of light and dark alternate with each other, but the nature of the void remains unchanged. So it is with the Mind of the Buddha and of sentient beings.
        </i></p>
        <br>
        <p><i><b>If you look upon the Buddha as presenting a pure, bright or Enlightened appearance, or upon sentient beings as presenting a foul, dark or mortal-seeming appearance, these conceptions resulting from attachment to form will keep you from supreme knowledge, even after the passing of as many aeons as there are sands in the Ganges.</b></i></p>
        <br>
        <p><i>There is only the One Mind and not a particle of anything else on which to lay hold, for this Mind is the Buddha.</i></p>
        <br>
        <p><i><b>If you students of the Way do not awake to this Mind substance, you will overlay Mind with conceptual thought, you will seek the Buddha outside yourselves, and you will remain attached to forms, pious practices and so on, all of which are harmful and not at all the way to supreme knowledge.</b></i></p>
        <br>
        <p><i><b>This Mind is no mind of conceptual thought</b> and it is completely detached from form.</i></p>
        <br>
        <p><i>So Buddhas and sentient beings do not differ at all. If you can only rid yourselves of conceptual thought, you will have accomplished everything.</i></p>
        <br>
        <p><i>But if you students of the Way do not rid yourselves of conceptual thought in a flash, even though you strive for aeon after aeon, you will never accomplish it.</i></p>
        <br>
        <p><i><b>Enmeshed in the meritorious practices of the Three Vehicles, you will be unable to attain Enlightenment.</b></i></p>
        <br>
        <p><i><b>When the people of the world hear it said that the Buddhas transmit the Doctrine of the Mind, they suppose that there is something to be attained or realized apart from Mind, and thereupon they use Mind to seek the Dharma, not knowing that Mind and the object of their search are one.</b></i></p>
        <br>
        <p><i>Mind cannot be used to seek something from Mind; for then, after the passing of millions of aeons, the day of success will still not have dawned. <b>Such a method is not to be compared with suddenly eliminating conceptual thought, which is the fundamental Dharma.</b></i></p>
        <br>
        <p><i>Suppose a warrior, forgetting that he was already wearing his pearl on his forehead, were to seek for it elsewhere, he could travel the whole world without finding it. But if someone who knew what was wrong were to point it out to him, the warrior would immediately realize that the pearl had been there all the time.</i></p>
        <br>
        <p><i><b>So, if you students of the Way are mistaken about your own real Mind, not recognizing that it is the Buddha, you will consequently look for him elsewhere, indulging in various achievements and practices and expecting to attain realization by such graduated practices. But, even after aeons of diligent searching, you will not be able to attain to the Way.</b></i></p>
        <br>
        <p><i><b>These methods cannot be compared to the sudden elimination of conceptual thought, in the certain knowledge that there is nothing at all which has absolute existence, nothing on which to lay hold, nothing on which to rely, nothing in which to abide, nothing subjective or objective.</b></i></p>
        <br>
        <p><i>A Buddha has three bodies. By the Dharmakāya is meant the Dharma of the omnipresent voidness of the real self-existent Nature of everything. By the Sambhogakāya is meant the Dharma of the underlying universal purity of things. By the Nirmānakāya is meant the Dharmas of the six practices leading to Nirvāna and all other such devices.</i></p>
        <br>
        <p><i><b>The Dharma of the Dharmakāya cannot be sought through speech or hearing or the written word.</b></i></p>
        <br>
        <p><i><b>There is nothing which can be said or made evident.</b> There is just the omnipresent voidness of the real self-existent Nature of everything, and no more. Therefore, saying that there is no Dharma to be explained in words is called preaching the Dharma.</i></p>
        <br>
        <p><i>The Sambhogakāya and the Nirmānakāya both respond with appearances suited to particular circumstances.</i></p>
        <br>
        <p><i><b>Spoken Dharmas which respond to events through the senses and in all sorts of guises are none of them the real Dharma.</b></i></p>
        <br>
        <p><i><b>So it is said that the Sambhogakāya or the Nirmanakāya is not a real Buddha or preacher of the Dharma.
        </b></i></p>
        <br>
        <p><i>Q: If Mind and the Buddha are intrinsically one, should we continue to practise the six pāramitās and the other orthodox means of gaining Enlightenment?</i></p>
        <br>
        <p><i><b>A: Enlightenment springs from Mind, regardless of your practice of the six pāramitās and the rest. All such practices are merely expedients for handling ‘concrete' matters when dealing with the problems of daily life.</b></i></p>
        <br>
        <p><i><b>Even Enlightenment, the Absolute, Reality, Sudden Attainment, the Dharmakāya and all the others down to the Ten Stages of Progress, the Four Rewards of virtuous and wise living and the State of Holiness and Wisdom are—every one of them—mere concepts for helping us through samsara; they have nothing to do with the real Buddha-Mind.</b></i></p>
        <br>
        <p><i>Since Mind is the Buddha, the ideal way of attainment is to cultivate that Buddha-Mind. <b>Only avoid conceptual thoughts, which lead to becoming and cessation, to the afflictions of the sentient world and all the rest; then you will have no need of methods of Enlightenment and suchlike.</b></i></p>
        <br>
        <p><i><b>You have always been one with the Buddha, so do not pretend you can attain to this oneness by various practices.</b></i></p>
        <br>
        <p><i>Give up those erroneous thoughts leading to false distinctions! There is no ‘self' and no ‘other'. There is no ‘wrong desire', no ‘anger', no ‘hatred', no ‘love', no ‘victory', no ‘failure'. <b>Only renounce the error of intellectual or conceptual thought-processes and your nature will exhibit its pristine purity</b> for this alone is the way to attain Enlightenment, to observe the Dharma, to become a Buddha and all the rest.</i></p>
        <br>
        <p><i><b>Unless you understand this, the whole of your great learning, your painful efforts to advance, your austerities of diet and clothing, will not help you to a knowledge of your own Mind. All such practices must be termed fallacious, for any of them will lead to your rebirth among ‘demons'—enemies of the truth—or among the crude nature spirits.</b></i></p>
        <br>
        <p><i><b>What end is served by pursuits like those?</b></i></p>
        <br>
        <p><i>As it is, so long as your mind is subject to the slightest movement of thought, <b>you will remain engulfed in the error of taking ‘ignorant' and ‘Enlightened' for separate states;</b> this error will persist regardless of your vast knowledge of the Mahāyāna or of your ability to pass through the ‘Four Grades of Sainthood' and the ‘Ten Stages of Progress Leading to Enlightenment'.</i></p>
        <br>
        <p><i><b>For all these pursuits belong to what is ephemeral; even the most strenuous of your efforts is doomed to fail, just as an arrow shot never so high into the air must inevitably fall spent to the ground. So, in spite of them, you are certain to find yourselves back on the wheel of life and death.</b></i></p>
        <br>
        <p><i><b>Indulging in such practices implies your failure to understand the Buddha's real meaning.</b></i></p>
        <br>
        <p><i><b>With the practices of the Pure Land Buddhists it is also thus, for all these practices are productive of karma; hence, we may call them Buddha-hindrances!</b></i></p>
        <br>
        <p><i>As they would obstruct your Mind, the chain of causation would also grapple you fast, dragging you back into the state of those as yet unliberated.</i></p>
        <br>
        <p><i><b>Though others may talk of the Way of the Buddhas as something to be reached by various pious practices and by Sūtra-study, you must have nothing to do with such ideas.</b></i></p>
        <br>
        <p><i>A perception, sudden as blinking, that subject and object are one, will lead to a deeply mysterious wordless understanding; and by this understanding will you awake to the truth of Zen.</i></p>
        <br>
        <p><i>When you happen upon someone who has no understanding, you must claim to know nothing. He may be delighted by his discovery of some ‘way to Enlightenment'; yet if you allow yourselves to be persuaded by him, you will experience no delight at all, but suffer both sorrow and disappointment.</i></p>
        <br>
        <p><i><b>What have such thoughts as his to do with the study of Zen?</b></i></p>
        <br>

        <h3><u>[Caodong] What's In A Name?</u></h3>
        <h3>Green Sage</h3>
        <h3>4/18/2020</h3>
        <p>The term "Soto" comes from the Chinse <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caodong_school">"Caodong"</a>("ts'áo" - "dòng") (which "Soto Zen" arguably does not represent).

            The Chinese characters are as follows:</p>
        <br>
        <p><b>"曹洞"</b></p>
        <br>
        <p>[曹] - "cao" - see the various definitions, as this term has a deep history in the Chinese language. Notice how many have meanings having to do with waters and rivers, however, and see below for why that may be relevant.</p>
        <br>
        <p>[洞] - "dong" - "cave / hole / zero (unambiguous spoken form when spelling out numbers)"; "cavity" / "leak" / "hole"; etc. (Edit: Speculation: "source"?)</p>
        <br>
        <p>This "dong" is the same "dong" as found in the name of Master <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dongshan_Liangjie">[Dongshan Liangjie]</a> ( 洞山良价).</p>
        <br>
        <p>Popular understanding (myth?) claims that "Caodong" is a portmanteau of the names of <a href="https://pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caoshan_Benji">[Caoshan Benji]</a> and Dongshan.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Is this true though?</p>
        <br>
        <p>The following is an excerpt from Andy Ferguson, a well-known author, writing about the biography of Caoshan:</p>
        <br>
        <p><i>CAOSHAN BENJI (840–901) was a foremost disciple of Dongshan. He was so closely associated with his teacher that their names were used together to form the name of their Zen school, Caodong. Caoshan came from ancient Quanzhou (a place still called Quanzhou in modern Fujian Province). When a youth, he studied Confucianism. Leaving home at the age of nineteen, Caoshan entered Lingshi Monastery in Fuzhou. When he received ordination at the age of twenty-five, Zen Buddhism was flourishing in Tang dynasty China.

            Later, after becoming Dongshan’s Dharma heir, Caoshan started a new temple in Fuzhou and named it Cao Shan (Mt. Cao), after the Sixth Ancestor, whose mountain name was derived from Cao Xi (Cao Creek). Thereafter, Caoshan lived and taught at Mt. Heyu, and is said to have changed the name of that place to Cao Shan as well. Caoshan used Dongshan’s “five ranks” as a method of instruction, leading to its wide use in Zen monasteries. This helped differentiate Caodong Zen as a unique Zen school.</i></p>
        <br>
        <p><i>- A. Ferguson, Zen's Chinese Heritage: The Masters and Their Teachings, Wisdom Publications, 2011, pp. 242-246)</i></p>
        <br>
        <p>According to Ferguson, Caoshan's entire name appears to be an homage to "the Sixth Ancestor" of Zen, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huineng">[Huineng]</a>. This, to me, seems like a much more "Zen" thing to do than founding a "school" named after yourself.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Keep in mind that "Shan" [山] in Chinese means "mountain", and that mountain-/geographic-based naming conventions were a prominent aspect of not only the Zen tradition, but a general Chinese cultural tradition as well. This is what (I think) Ferguson means by the term "mountain name."</p>
        <br>
        <p>Regardless, both "Caoshan" and "Dongshan" were labels given to real, actual people who really didn't care a whole lot about labels.</p>
        <br>
        <p>I suspect that "Caodong" is a similar such label and probably developed after the fact in order to categorize an older tradition under scholarship. I'm not saying that's a bad thing, that's the same sort of thing we do here (well, some of us) and pretty much what I'm doing right now.</p>
        <br>
        <p>But the important thing is not to lose the thread; to be honest and clear about your knowledge.</p>
        <br>
        <p>In that light, let's consider the idea that the notion of "Caodong" as a portmanteau of "Caoshan" and "Dongshan" is actually a misunderstanding based on ad hoc scholarship.</p>
        <br>
        <p>In the Wiki entry for Dongshan, there is a section titled <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dongshan_Liangjie#Establishing_the_Caodong_school_of_Chan">"Establishing the Caodong school of Chan"</a> which, despite it's title, doesn't really explain how he allegedly did that:</p>
        <br>
        <p><i>At the age of fifty-two, Dongshan established a mountain school at the mountain named Dongshan (in what is now the city of Gao'an in Jiangxi province). The cloister temple he founded bore such names as Guanfu (広福寺), Gongde (功德寺), Chongxian Longbao (崇先隆報寺) but was named Puli Yuan (普利院) in the early Song dynasty period. Here, according to tradition, he composed the Song of the Precious Mirror Samādhi. His disciples here are said to have numbered between five hundred and one thousand.</i></p>
        <br>
        <p><i>This Caodong school became regarded as one of the Five Houses of Zen. At the time, they were just considered schools led by individualistic masters with distinct styles and personalities; in reality, the fact that they were all—with the exception of Linji—located in close geographic proximity to each other and that they all were at the height of their teaching around the same time, established a custom among students to routinely visit the other masters.</i></p>
        <br>
        <p>So, we see that Dongshan established a mountain school and either named himself after the mountain--just like many other masters did--or the mountain came to be associated with him afterwards; the school he founded was called many things over time; and it was at this school that Dongshan is said to have composed a famous poem.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Then we jump right to "The Caodong school became regarded as ..." ... wait, did I miss something?</p>
        <br>
        <p>Where was the naming?</p>
        <br>
        <p>In fact, the bolded part above seems to indicate that there was absolutely no tradition of creating an abstract name for a "school" and seeing it as an institution.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Amazingly, the Wiki entry for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caodong_school">"Caodong School"</a> basically echoes the doubts I'm raising in this OP, does nothing to address them, and in literally the next line (edit: if we ignore the sentence of lies right before it; sorry) completely forgets them and repeats the conventional "knowledge":</p>
        <br>
        <p><i>ETYMOLOGY</i></p>
        <br>
        <p><i>The key figure in the Caodong school was founder Dongshan Liangjie (807-869, Jpn. Tozan Ryokai). Some attribute the name "Cáodòng" as a union of "Dongshan" and "Caoshan", the latter from one of Dongshan's Dharma-heirs, Caoshan Benji; (840-901, Ts'ao-shan Pen-chi, Jpn. Sōzan Honjaku). <b>However, the "Cao" much more likely came from Cáoxī (曹溪), the "mountain-name" of Huineng, the Sixth Ancestor of Chan, as Caoshan was of little importance unlike his contemporary and fellow Dharma-heir, Yunju Daoying.</b> The school emphasised sitting meditation, and later "silent illumination" techniques.</i></p>
        <br>
        <p><i>HISTORY</i></p>
        <br>
        <p><i><b>The Caodong school was founded by Dongshan Liangjie and his Dharma-heir Caoshan Benji. Dongshan traced back his lineage to Shitou Xiqian (700-790), a contemporary of Mazu Daoyi (709–788).</b></i></p>
        <br>
        <p>So if Caoshan named himself (or was later named) after a mountain school which he himself named as an homage to the "mountain name" attributed to Huineng, which wasn't really a name taken from a mountain but from a river or stream, why would it make any sense that the "dong" in "Caodong" would refer to the mountain name of Dongshan with the intention of referring to the "person, Dongshan"?</p>
        <br>
        <p>Wouldn't it make more sense that the "Cao" was named after the "Cao" already well-known in the Zen tradition (which is what the above quote all-but says) and that the "Dong" would likewise follow suit?</p>
        <br>
        <p>Doesn't the dictionary definition for "Dong" intrigue you and seem much more appealing than simply being a superficial moniker?</p>
        <br>
        <p>I think Thomas Cleary's comments in his intro to the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Blue-Cliff-Record-Thomas-Cleary-ebook/dp/B00DMC5H8I/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&keywords=Blue+Cliff+Record&qid=1587206684&sr=8-1">Blue Cliff Record ("BCR")</a> presents good evidence:</p>
        <br>
        <p><i>Huineng had become enlightened in his mid-twenties while a poor woodcutter in the frontier lands of south China. He later traveled north to see Hongren workman in Hongren's community at Huangmei.</i></p>
        <br>
        <p><i>Hongren recognized Huineng's enlightenment and after a short time passed on to him the robe and bowl of Bodhidharma as symbols of the patriarchate; he did this in secret, it is said, and sent Huineng away, fearing the jealous wrath of the monks because Huineng was a peasant from the uncivilized far south with no formal training in Buddhism.</i></p>
        <br>
        <p><i>After fifteen years of wandering, Huineng reappeared in south China, became ordained as a Buddhist monk, and began to teach at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nanhua_Temple">Baolin Monastery</a> near the source of Cao <a href="https://dictionary.writtenchinese.com/#sk=%E6%BA%AA&svt=pinyin">[Xi]</a> in the Cao Valley River. (Note: I don't know if it's an error or an oversight, but it appears that Huineng went north again).</i></p>
        <br>
        <p><i>He awakened many people, and most of the teachers who appear in The Blue Cliff Record were descended from Huineng.</i></p>
        <br>
        <p>Cleary's account corroborates all which has been said up to here. Huineng ended up near a place that was already significant in Chinese culture called the "Cao Xi" in the Cao Valley and, since Huineng was essentially the source of all the major masters following him, the "Cao Xi" is a reference to his lineage and what he stood for.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Excerpts from the BCR back this up:</p>
        <br>
        <p>(Case 5)</p>
        <br>
        <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xuedou_Chongxian">[Xuedou's]</a> verse:</p>
        <br>
        <p><i>An ox head disappears,
            A horse head emerges.
            In the mirror of Cao Xi,^a absolutely no dust.
            He beats the drum for you to come look, but you don't see:
            When spring arrives, for whom do the hundred flowers bloom?</i></p>
        <br>
        <p>Footnote:</p>
        <br>
        <p><i>
            a. Cao Xi was the abode of the great Sixth Patriarch of Chinese Ch'an, Huineng (also known as 'workman Lu'), and is used to refer to him, as well as to his inspiration and lineage.</i></p>
        <br>
        <p>(Case 7)</p>
        <br>
        <p><i>One day when Fayen had ascended his seat, there was a monk who asked, "What is one drop from the fount of Cao Xi?"</i></p>
        <p><i>Fayen said, "It's one drop from the fount of Cao Xi."</i></p>
        <p><i>The monk was dumbfounded and withdrew; [National Teacher Deshao], who was in the assembly, was suddenly greatly enlightened when he heard this. Later he appeared in the world as one of Fayen's successors.</i></p>
        <br>
        <p>What did Deshao understand that enlightened him? And I am really curious as to what word is used for "fount" here ... something to look up later.</p>
        <br>
        <p>(Case 20)</p>
        <br>
        <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yuanwu_Keqin">[Yuanwu's]</a> 7th note to the case:</p>
        <br>
        <p><i><b>If the waves of Cao Xi resembled each other, endless numbers of ordinary people would get bogged down.</b> One punishment for all crimes; they're buried in the same pit.</i></p>
        <br>
        <p>We can also see from Yuanwu's commentary in the BCR that "Caodong" was a term already employed in the tradition during his lifetime (the 11th and 12th centuries).</p>
        <br>
        <p>(Case 16)</p>
        <br>
        <p><i>This monk (in the case) was also a guest of his house, and understood (Chingqing's) household affairs; therefore he questioned like this: "I am breaking out; I ask the Teacher to break in." Within <b>the Caodong tradition</b> this is called using phenomena to illustrate one's condition. How so? When the chick breaks out and the mother breaks in, naturally they are perfectly simultaneous.</i></p>
        <br>
        <p>From what I can tell, "Caodong" is only used twice in the BCR, and the next use of it completely contradicts the conventional claim:</p>
        <br>
        <p>(Case 89)</p>
        <br>
        <p><i>Yunyan and Daowu were fellow students under Yaoshan. For forty years Yunyan's side did not touch his mat. <b>Yaoshan produced the whole Caodong school.</b> There were three men with whom the Path of Dharma flourished: descended from Yunyen was Dongshan; descended from Daowu was Shishuang; and descended from Quanzhu was Jiashan.</i></p>
        <br>
        <p>So, according to Yuanwu, who was clearly aware of a "Caodong School" it was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yaoshan_Weiyan">[Yaoshan Weiyan]</a> who founded the Caodong school.</p>
        <br>
        <p>It may be more likely that Dongshan's nomiker was influenced by his relationship to the "Caodong School" <b>and not the other way around.</b></p>
        <br>
        <p>This makes much more sense given everything else we see in the Zen tradition and means that the term "Caodong" is itself a device or entryway to understanding, not some ego-centric sectarian category.</p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>LMAO, a very important "P.S." to add here, and another terrific self-pwn by Dogen (I really couldn't hate the guy at this point, I can't help but feel some pity for him haha)</p>
        <br>
        <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S%C5%8Dt%C5%8D#Chinese_origins">(From Wiki: "Soto Zen" : "Chinese Origins")</a></p>
        <br>
        <p><i>One prevalent view is that the sect's name was originally formed by taking one character each from the names of Dòngshān and his disciple Cáoshān Běnjì (曹山本寂, Japanese: Sōzan Honjaku), and was originally called Dòngcáo-zōng (with the characters in transposed order).</i></p>
        <p><i><b>However, to paraphrase the Dòngshān yǔlù (《洞山語録》, "Record of the Dialogues of Dòngshān"), the sect's name denotes 'colleagues (曹) of the teachings above the caves (洞)' who together follow the "black wind"[citation needed] and admire the masters of various sects.</b></i></p>
        <p><i>Perhaps more significantly for the Japanese brand of this sect, <b>Dōgen among others advocated the reinterpretation that the "Cao" represents not Caoshan, but rather "Huineng of Caoxi temple" 曹渓慧能 (Sōkei Enō); zh:曹溪慧能).</b> The branch that was founded by Caoshan died off, and Dōgen was a student of the other branch that survived in China.</i></p>
        <br>
        <p>So Dogen himself advocates for an equivalent or similar understanding of "CaoDong" and further admits that he was not in the "Caodong" lineage which would fit, what I will now call, the conventional myth (i.e. the "lineage" supposedly founded by Caoshan Benji).</p>
        <br>
        <p>He ties himself to Dongshan, which I don't think will end well for Dogen. If I had to speculate, I'd say he did this to add legitimacy to his own school under the assumption (correct at the time) that people couldn't fact-check his claims by comparing his teachings to Dongshan's record or ... worse ... those masters preceding Dongshan. But now that we can, this gamble comes back to bite Dogen's entire school.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Anyway, I think the next text that warrants a visit is the Dongshan yulu.</p>

        <br>
        <p><i>If you try to ask, you have already deviated, and reality-nature and form have been separated. Make no mistake about it, people.</i></p>
        <br>
        <p><i>All phenomena--worldly and world-transcending--are without a real fixed identity of their own, they have no inherent nature.</i></p>
        <br>
        <p><i>There are just empty names, and names are empty too. If you go on this way accepting these empty names as real things, you are making a great mistake.</i></p>
        <br>
        <p><i>Even if they are there, they are all objects and scenes dependent on transformation [for their temporary being].</i></p>
        <br>
        <p><i>There is also such a thing as depending on bodhi and nirvana and liberation, depending on the three bodies of buddha, depending on objective wisdom, depending on bodhisattvas and buddhas.</i></p>
        <br>
        <h3><i>What are you looking for in lands dependent upon transformation?</i></h3>
        <br>
        <h3><i>Even the multi-part scriptural teachings of the three vehicles are just old paper for wiping away filth.</i></h3>
        <br>
        <h3><i>Buddha is an illusion, an apparition. The ancestral teachers were just old monks.</i></h3>
        <br>
        <p><i>Weren’t you born from your mama?</i></p>
        <br>
        <p><i>If you seek buddha, you are controlled by the delusion "buddha." If you seek the ancestral teachers, you are bound by the delusion "ancestral teachers."</i></p>
        <br>
        <p><i>As long as you have seeking, it’s all suffering.</i></p>
        <br>
        <p><i>Better to have no concerns at all.</i></p>
        <br>
        <p><i>There’s a kind of bald monk who says to students: "Buddha is the ultimate. You only achieve enlightenment after the fulfillment of the results of three immeasurable eons of cultivating practice."</i></p>
        <br>
        <p><i>Good people, if you think Buddha is the ultimate, then why did he lie down and die at the age of eighty between the twin trees in <a href="https://www.matthieuricard.org/en/blog/posts/kusinagar-where-the-buddha-passed-into-parinirvana">{the grove at Kusinagara?}</a></i></p>
        <br>
        <p><i>Where is Buddha today?</i></p>
        <br>
        <p><i>It’s clear that he was born and died no different from us.</i></p>
        <br>
        <p><i>You might say that the thirty-two auspicious marks and the eighty excellent qualities make him a buddha, and a wheel-turning sage king must be a tathagata. But you should understand clearly that these are all illusory apparitions.</i></p>
        <br>
        <p><i>The man of old [Mahasattva Fu] said: "The tathagatas take on bodily form in order to accord with worldly feelings. Fearing people would form nihilistic views, [Buddha] provisionally established some empty names, temporarily talking of the thirty-two marks and the eighty excellent qualities. These too are empty words. If there is a body, it’s not the essential body of enlightenment. Formlessness is the true shape."</i></p>
        <br>
        <p><i>You may say that Buddha has six spiritual powers that are inconceivable. But all the devas, the immortals, the asuras, and the powerful demons also have spiritual powers. Does this mean they must be buddhas too? Don’t go wrong about this.</i></p>
        <br>
        <p><i>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asura">{Asuras}</a> did battle with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indra">{Indra}</a>, king of the gods, and when they were defeated, they gathered together their host of 84,000 and hid in a hole in a lotus fiber.</i></p>
        <br>
        <p><i>Isn’t this supernatural?</i></p>
        <br>
        <p><i>All these examples I’ve cited are cases of spiritual powers due to karma and dependent [on contrived techniques]. In the case of the Buddha’s six spiritual powers, it is not so.</i></p>
        <br>
        <p><i>Buddha enters form, sound, smell, taste, touch, and concepts without being deluded by them.</i></p>
        <br>
        <p><i>Thus, since he has arrived at the emptiness of form, sound, smell, taste, touch, and concepts, these cannot bind the independent person of the Path.</i></p>
        <br>
        <p><i>For him, even the defiled body of form, sensation, conception, motivation, and consciousness is in itself a spiritual power for walking upon the earth.</i></p>
        <br>
        <h3><i>Good people, the real Buddha is formless; the real Dharma has no marks.</i></h3>
        <br>
        <p><i>The way you are acting is to erect models and patterns based upon the illusory transformations [which were provisionally put forward in the Buddhist teachings]. Even if you get something from this, you are all wild fox spirits. This is not real Buddhism at all, but the view of outsiders.</i></p>
        <br>
        <p><i>People who study the Path genuinely do not grasp buddhas or bodhisattvas or arhats; they do not grasp attainments of special excellence within the triple world.</i></p>
        <br>
        <p><i>They are transcendent and free and on their own—they are not constrained by things.</i></p>
        <br>
        <p><i>Even if heaven and earth turn upside down, they are not in doubt.</i></p>
        <br>
        <p><i>If all the buddhas of the ten directions appear before them, they feel no joy.</i></p>
        <br>
        <p><i>If [all the torments of] the hungry ghosts, the animals, and the beings in hell appear before them, they feel no fear.</i></p>
        <br>
        <p><i>Why are they like this?</i></p>
        <br>
        <p><i>They see the emptiness of all phenomena, which exist through transformation and don’t exist without it. They see that the triple world is only mind, and the myriad things are only consciousness.</i></p>
        <br>
        <p><i>Therefore, why bother to grasp [what are really] dreamlike illusions and apparitions?</i></p>
        <br>
        <h3><i>There is only the person in all of you right here and now listening to the Dharma.</i></h3>
        <br>
        <h3><i>This person enters fire without being burned and water without being drowned. This person enters the mires of hell as if strolling in a garden sightseeing. This person enters the planes of the hungry ghosts and animals without being subject to their suffering.</i></h3>
        <br>
        <p><i>Why so?</i></p>
        <br>
        <p><i>Because for this person there is nothing to reject, nothing to avoid.</i></p>
        <br>
        <h3><i>If you love the holy and hate the ordinary, you float and sink in the sea of birth and death.</i></h3>
        <br>
        <p><i>Affliction exists because of mind: if you have no mind, how can affliction hold you?</i></p>
        <br>
        <p><i>If you do not try to discriminate and grasp forms, naturally you find the Path that instant.</i></p>

        <br>
        <p><i>These two are each distinct; how do you understand the logic of identity? You have to experience the mind without seeking; then they will integrate and you will get to be trouble-free.</i></p>

        <p><i>Even if you trust directly in the rightness of reality this very moment, already you are called a dullard; how much the more if you cannot trust directly— what are you good for then?</i></p>

        <h3><u>Greensight / Highdea: Zazen is an Insidious Placebo</u></h3>
        <h3>Green Sage</h3>
        <h3>3/10/2020</h3>
        <p>I was thinking about ways in which people are "enlightened" but don't realize it, and realized that if people penetrate deeply in connection with a zazen experience, they probably do actually penetrate deeply BUT because they are so convinced that it was "the zazen" it's forever out of their reach.</p>
        <br>
        <p>It's worse than someone who hasn't penetrated at all, because though that person may have more difficulties or take longer (for the sake of argument) than someone who penetrates via zazen ... that person will have no other "thing" to blame/credit for the penetration except themselves and so they will see.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Whereas the zazen practitioner, though they may have penetrated, cannot believe (or will have a tough time believing) that the zazen wasn't responsible; that it was just them all along.</p>
        <br>
        <p>What's really disturbing is that their confusion is completely understandable given their experience. Hence why I say it is an "insidious placebo."</p>
        <br>
        <p>It's like a placebo that is also a drug.</p>
        <br>
        <p>The more I examine the connection, the more I am convinced zazen is just a drugless-drug.</p>
        <br>
        <p>To me, it's like taking acid: if the experience is transparent to you, and you know it's your mind, not the acid/zazen that is directing the experience, then it can be a very beautiful and valuable experience for the practitioner ... but it's constantly begging to entangle with your understanding and graft onto it like a parasite.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Anyway, I just figured as long as everyone else was shit-posting their Woke Strokes I could get in on the fun. XD</p>

        <br>
        <p><i>I explain the Dharma differently from anyone else.
        </i></p>
        <br>
        <p><i>If {Manjushri} or {Samantabhadra} appear before me in some manifestation to ask about the Dharma, as soon as they open their mouths to ask for instruction, I’ve already sized them up.</i></p>
        <br>
        <p><i>I am securely seated.</i></p>
        <br>
        <p><i>When you people come to meet with me, I have already sized you all up.</i></p>
        <br>
        <p><i>Why is it this way?</i></p>
        <br>
        <p><i>Because my perception is different.</i></p>
        <br>
        <p><i>Externally I do not seize upon ordinary or holy, and inwardly I do not abide in the [fundamental].</i></p>
        <br>
        <p><i>When you see all the way through things, there are no more doubts or deceptions.</i></p>
        <br>
        <p><i>The Buddha Dharma is effortless:</i></p>
        <br>
        <p><i>Just be without concerns in your ordinary life, as you shit and piss and wear clothes and eat food.</i></p>
        <br>
        <p><i>When tired, then lie down.</i></p>
        <br>
        <p><i>Fools will laugh at you, but the wise will know.</i></p>
        <br>
        <p><i>An ancient said: "Those who make external efforts are all stupid and obstinate. Just act the master wherever you are, and where you stand is real."</i></p>
        <br>
        <p><i>When objects appear they cannot turn you around. Though the uninterrupted hellish karma of the habit energy of your past is still there, it spontaneously becomes the great ocean of liberation.</i></p>
        <br>
        <p><i>These days students in general do not know the Dharma.They are like goats:</i></p>
        <br>
        <p><i>Whatever they encounter, they put in their mouths.</i></p>
        <br>
        <p><i>They do not distinguish between the slaves and the free, the guests and the host.</i></p>
        <br>
        <p><i>This type enter the Path with twisted minds. Even though they cannot enter places where it’s noisy, they call themselves true leavers of home. Actually they are true conventional worldlings.</i></p>
        <br>
        <p><i>As for leavers of home, they must be able to perceive with true understanding in ordinary life. They distinguish enlightenment and delusion, true and false, ordinary and holy. If you can make these distinctions, you are called a true leaver of home. If you cannot tell deluding from enlightening influences, then you have left one home [ordinary life] only to enter another home [cultish ‘religious’ allegiances]. Then you are called a sentient being creating karma, not a true leaver of home.</i></p>
        <br>
        <p><i>Right now there’s something where enlightenment and delusion share the same substance undivided. It’s like water and milk mixed together: the king goose drinks only the milk.
        </i></p>
        <br>
        <h3><i>People of the Path with clear eyes will reject both delusion and enlightenment. If you love holy things and hate ordinary things, you float and sink in the sea of birth and death.</i></h3>
        <br>
        <p><i>Someone asked: “What are enlightenment and delusion?”</i></p>
        <br>
        <p><i>Linji said: "A moment when your mind is in doubt is delusion. If you can comprehend that the myriad phenomena are unborn, that [deluded] mind is like an illusory transformation, so that you are everywhere pure, this is enlightenment. So enlightenment and delusion are the two objects, defilement and purity."</i></p>
        <br>
        <p><i>“In my view, there are no buddhas and no sentient beings, no ancient and no modern."</i></p>
        <br>
        <p><i>"Those who attain, attain without cultivation, without realization, without gain, and without loss, for them there is never anything else but reality. ‘Even if there is anything that goes beyond this, I would say that it is like a dream or a magical illusion.’ This is what I am saying."</i></p>

        <p>The following is included at the end of Cleary's translation of The Blue Cliff Record. As Cleary notes, the source is "Shigetsu Ein's Funogo san ro, da, shi i rui, a 'Non-talk on the three roads, (three) falls, and four different kinds' (1761). Shigetsu was a Soto Zen master, a Japanese descendant of Caodong Zen."</p>

        <p><b>So take words like "attainment" with a grain of salt.</b></p>

        <p>And for that reason, further compare with <a href="https://selfdefinition.org/zen/dongshan/thomas-cleary-comments-on-five-ranks-etc.htm">[these excerpts of Cleary's own descriptions of Dongshan's devices]</a> and for even further authenticity, go straight to Dongshan himself.</p>

        <br>
        <h3><i>For innumerable aeons, since there has been self, this stinking skinbag has been changed from time to time, transformed from place to place, in a thousand conditions, ten thousand forms; who can reach the realm of our fundamental quiescence?</i></h3>
        <br>
        <p><i>If you get here, you must know this road. "This road" means while dwelling in the present heap of sound and form, first getting rid of clinging to self, and attaining our former original state of selflessness. And furthermore, you must know that all things have no self. Once person and things are selfless, in your daily activities you walk in the void. This life basically has an undefiled practice and experience; thus would we practice and experience nondefilement. Today you must diligently walk in the void. Walking in the void is not some special art; each day when you go into the hall, you should not chew through a single grain of rice. Not chewing through a single grain of rice means that there is no breaking of the fast or violation of discipline by arousing mindfulness of tasting flavor. This is called traveling the bird's path.</i></p>
        <br>
        <p><i>Travel on the bird's path is trackless; when you don't leave your body in the realm of tracklessness, this is the turning point of an ascetic. After you have arrived here and settled here, there is still one road going beyond. This road is not in going or coming; it is what is called "moss growing in the jade palace." All the names of the Other Side are temporary names for this. In reality, it is the one road that cannot be touched upon. That is why we say "hidden." And "hidden" is not a matter of giving a name as its meaning; the realm called the hidden road is the realm of no name or meaning. This is why it is said, "He has no country; he does not abide, dwells in no home."</i></p>
        <br>
        <p><i>To know this and yet be able to not remain here, to be an example for beings, to inspire and lead them, unify and teach them, is called "extending the hands." In extending the hands, there is no separate road; it does not transgress the bird's path. Traveling the bird's path by yourself, yet you extend your hands. In the bird's path there is no separate road; knowing the hidden road yourself, you still don't transgress it. Dwelling in the bird's path, you don't sprout horns on your head but always extend your hands.</i></p>
        <br>
        <p><i>Thus the three roads are the cause and effect of the great practice; and the cause and effect spreads vast and wide throughout the whole universe.</i></p>

        <p><i>People [today] want to understand theoretically at once, as soon as anything is said.</i></p>
        <br>
        <p><i>How can you learn the Way in this fashion?</i></p>
        <br>
        <p><i>Sometimes I see beginners come to interviews helpless to do anything about the fact that I have already seen through them. They are like villagers armed with carrying poles trying to do battle with a general!</i></p>
        <br>
        <p><i>Here I am fully equipped; in my hand is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_Dragon_Crescent_Blade">[hundred-pound sword]</a> of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guan_Yu#Physical_appearance">[legendary warrior]</a>, while they have nothing but a carrying pole. They strike a blow, and, seeing the man not move, they strike several more times and leave. It’s not that I fear them; it’s because they are no match for me. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a-FzIVnDJE&feature=youtu.be&t=2&ab_channel=xexyzl">[Ha, ha!]</a></i></p>
        <br>
        <p><i>I urge you not to be crude minded.</i></p>
        <br>
        <p><i>In your conduct, day and night, keep evolving higher; then even if you do not attain enlightenment, you will still be a highly refined individual.</i></p>
        <p><i>Be sure to be attentive!</i></p>
        <br>
        <p><i>The original true Zen Masters are <a href="https://inthewordsofbuddha.wordpress.com/2016/02/06/kalyanamitta-the-buddhas-teachings-on-friendship/">[real true friends]</a>.</i></p>

        <br>
        <p><i>One can only say this much; if you understand, you can have the experience yourself. Then you will have something to act on. If you get involved in rationalizations, comparisons, and verbalizations, then you do not understand, and you cannot experience it yourself.</i></p>
        <br>
        <p><i>When you are going about and doing your chores, do you see that the original Zen Masters are real true friends? Since you don’t see, when asked about it you get flustered.</i></p>
        <br>
        <p><i>Where is the problem? The problem lies in the fact that you are always coming from the midst of conceptual comparisons, and do not personally attain experience. All of you go sit on benches, close your eyes, and demolish your thinking all the way from the Milky Way above to Hades below before you can make a statement or two.</i></p>
        <br>
        <p><i>But when you get to a quiet place, you still don’t get the ultimate point. Before your eyes is nothing but things that obstruct people.</i></p>
        <br>
        <p><i>Lightly questioned, you cannot reach the aim.</i></p>

        <h3><u>[Kashyapa] Kashyapa! Kashyapa! Wherefore art thou Kashyapa?!</u></h3>
        <h3>Green Sage</h3>
        <h3>3/04/2020</h3>
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kashyapa">(Wikipedia:)</a>
        <br>
        <p><i>[Kashyapa] is a revered Vedic sage of Hinduism. He was one of the Saptarishis, the seven ancient sages of the Rigveda, numerous Sanskrit texts and Indian mythologies. He is the most ancient rishi listed in the colophon verse in the Brihadaranyaka Upanishad.</i></p>
        <br>
        <p><i>Kashyapa is a common ancient name, referring to many different personalities in the ancient Hindu and Buddhist texts.</i></p>
        <p><i>Kaśyapa, alternatively kacchapa, means "turtle" in Sanskrit. According to Michael Witzel, it is related to Avestan kasiiapa, Sogdian kyšph, New Persian kašaf, kaš(a)p which mean "tortoise", after which Kashaf Rūd or a river in Turkmenistan and Khorasan is named. Other relations include to Tokarian B kaccāp ("brainpan"), Polish kacap (czerep, "brainpan", "hardliner"), Tokarian A kāccap ("turtle", "tortoise"). Frits Staal agrees that Kaśyapa means tortoise but believes that it is a non-Indo-European word.</i></p>
        <br>
        <p><i>In Buddhist Pali canonical texts such as Digha Nikaya, Tevijja Sutta describes a discussion between the Buddha and Vedic scholars of his time. The Buddha names ten rishis, calls them "early sages" and makers of ancient verses that have been collected and chanted in his era, and among those ten rishi is [Kassapa] (the Pali spelling of Kashyapa in Sanskrit).</i></p>
        <br>
        <p><i>(Blue Cliff Record:)</i></p>
        <br>
        <h3><i>Yunmen showed his staff to the assembly and said, "The staff has changed into a dragon and swallowed the universe. Mountains, rivers, the great earth--where are they to be found?"</i></h3>
        <br>
        <p><i>As for Yunmen's saying, "The staff has changed into a dragon and swallowed the universe. Where are the mountains, rivers, and earth to be found?" If you say it exists, then you are blind; if you say it doesn't exist, then you are dead. Do you see where Yunmen helped people? Bring the staff back to me!</i></p>
        <br>
        <p><i><b>People these days do not understand where Yunmen stood alone and revealed. Instead they say that he went to form to explain mind, that he relied on things to reveal principle. But old Shakyamuni couldn't have not known this theory as he taught the Dharma for forty-nine years; why then did he also need to hold up the flower for Kashyapa's smile? This old fellow caused confusion saying, "I have the treasury of the eye of the correct teaching, the wondrous mind of nirvana--these I pass on to MahaKashyapa." Why was there still a need for the specially transmitted mind seal? Given that all of you are guests in the house of the ancestral teachers, do you understand this specially transmitted mind?</b></i></p>
        <br>
        <p><i>If there is a single thing in your breast, then mountains, rivers, and the great earth appear in profusion before you; if there isn't a single thing in your breast, then outside there is not so much as a fine hair. How can you talk about principle and knowledge fusing, about objective world and mind merging? What's the reason? When one is understood, all are understood; when one is clear, all are clear.</i></p>
        <br>
        <p><i>(BCR:)</i></p>
        <br>
        <p><i>Stand on the summit of the highest peak, and demons and outsiders cannot know you; walk on the bottom of the deepest sea, and even the Buddha's eye cannot catch sight of you. Even if your eyes are like shooting stars and your intellect is like flashing lightning, still you won't avoid (being like) the spirit tortoise dragging his tail (leaving traces.) At this point, what is proper?</i></p>

        <h3><u>[Huangbo] "The Way" is just a figure of speech ...</u></h3>
        <h3>Green Sage</h3>
        <h3>3/03/2020</h3>
        <p>A little mellow Huangbo for your Tuesday day cruising, buddhas and budhettes, wherever you are out there in the Buddhasphere, driving around in your little vehicles.</p>
        <br>
        <p>This is Radio Buddha, bringing you all the mellow vibes for your karmic drives, kalpa in and kalpa out.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Huangbo singing us a little tune in his classic style. Though he uses buddhist language and imagery, he massages it to accord with the Way; either "clarifying" or "re-defining it", that's up to you.</p>
        <br>
        <p>One Mind y'all.</p>
        <br>
        <p><i>(Huangbo, Mind Transmission; translated by Blofeld)</i></p>
        <p><i>Regarding this Zen Doctrine of ours, since it was first transmitted, it has never taught that people should seek for learning or form concepts.</i></p>
        <br>
        <p><i>"Studying the Way" is just a figure of speech.</i></p>
        <br>
        <p><i>It is a method of arousing people's interest in the early stages of their development. In fact, the Way is not something which can be studied. Study leads to the retention of concepts and so the Way is entirely misunderstood. Moreover, the Way is not something specially existing; it is called the Mahāyāna (Great Vehicle) Mind—Mind which is not to be found inside, outside or in the middle.</i></p>
        <br>
        <p><i>Truly it is not located anywhere.</i></p>
        <br>
        <p><i>The first step is to refrain from knowledge-based concepts. This implies that if you were to follow the empirical method to the utmost limit, on reaching that limit you would still be unable to locate Mind.</i></p>
        <br>
        <p><i>The Way is spiritual truth and was originally without name or title. It was only because people ignorantly sought for it empirically that the Buddhas appeared and taught them to eradicate this method of approach. Fearing that nobody would understand, they selected the name "Way"("Dao").</i></p>
        <br>
        <p><i>You must not allow this name to lead you into forming a mental concept of a road. So it is said, "When the fish is caught we pay no more attention to the trap."</i></p>
        <br>
        <p><i>When body and mind achieve spontaneity, the Way is reached and Mind is understood. A [sramana] is so called because he has penetrated to the original source of all things. The fruit of attaining the sramana stage is gained by putting an end to all anxiety; it does not come from book-learning.</i></p>

        <h3><u>[Linji] Cultivating Sages is for Blind Shavepate</u></h3>
        <h3>Green Sage</h3>
        <h3>3/02/2020</h3>
        <p><i>(Record of Linji; Cleary translation)</i></p>
        <p><i>Outside of mind there is nothing, and what is within mind is also unattainable. What are you looking for? All of you people everywhere talk of having cultivation and having realization, but don’t make this mistake. Even if you gain something from cultivation, it is just the karma of birth and death. You say you cultivate the six perfections and the myriad practices, but as I see it you are just building karma. When you seek Buddha and seek the Dharma, you are creating hellish karma. When you seek to be bodhisattvas, you are also creating karma. When you read the sutras, you are also creating karma. The buddhas and ancestral teachers were people without concerns. Thus they make nothing but pure karma, whether they are in the defiled realm of contrived action, or in the stainless realm without contrived action.</i></p>
        <br>
        <p><i>There are a certain kind of blind shave-pates who eat their fill of food and then go to sit in meditation. They grab hold of wayward thoughts and do not let them go on. Weary of noise, they seek quietude. These are not Buddhist methods. The ancestral teacher [Shenhui of Heze] said: "If you fixate your mind and contemplate stillness, hold up your mind for outer awareness and hold in your mind for inner realization, freeze your mind and enter stable concentration, this is all contrived activity."</i></p>
        <br>
        <p><i>It is the person in you who is listening to the Dharma this way right now. How can you try to cultivate this person or realize him or adorn him? He is not something that can be cultivated or adorned. If we would have him adorned, in fact all things are what adorn him</i></p>
        <br>
        <p>.......</p>
        <br>
        <p><i>Good people, if you can comprehend like this, you will avoid being obstructed by ordinary and holy names. [Otherwise, as usual] you interpret the empty fist as if it really held something and vainly concoct strange things among the elements of sensory experience. You slight yourselves when you bow out saying that you are only ordinary people, while those [who succeeded on the Path] were sages.</i></p>
        <br>
        <p><i>You shaven-headed ones with many births to go, what is the big hurry? You have put on a lion’s skin, yet you howl like little foxes. You are really great people, but you do not breathe with the energy of the really great. You refuse to believe in what’s in your own house, and instead go seeking outside like this. You fall into traps with the empty and free names and formulations used by the ancients and try to make patterns of categories by depending on them, but you are unable to comprehend them on your own. When you encounter objects you become entangled; when you meet with sensory experiences you grasp them. Delusion arises everywhere you touch; you have no sure stability of your own.</i></p>
        <br>
        <p><i>Good people of the Path, do not grasp what I say. Why? Because verbal explanations have no basis: they are temporary sketches on the void, like images formed of colored clouds. Good people, do not think ‘Buddha’ is the ultimate. I see [such dualistic views of an external buddha] as a stink-hole. [Concepts of] ‘bodhisattva’ and ‘arhat’ are fetters and chains, things to bind people with. That’s why [in the stories in the sutras] [Manjusri] slew Buddha with his sword and [Angulimala] took his knife and wounded Buddha. Good people, there is no buddha that can be attained. Even the three vehicles, the five categories of beings, the round and the sudden manifestations of the teachings, [and all Buddhist formulations] are all just medicines to deal with the diseases of a certain period. There is no real doctrine at all. If there are [doctrinal teachings], they are open announcements that show some semblance of [real truth], public verbal demonstrations. Arranged for effect, they explain as they do for the time being.</i></p>
        <br>
        <p><i>Good people, there are some misguided monks who attach their efforts to what is in these teachings, trying to find a world-transcending truth, but they are making a mistake. If people seek Buddha, they lose Buddha; if they seek the Path, they lose the Path; if they seek the patriarchs, they lose the patriarchs.</i></p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>Don't seek, and you shall find.</p>
        <p>Only one way to find out ...</p>

        <br>
        <p><i>"In over ten years at one place, I couldn’t find a worthy opponent; only when I went elsewhere did I actually see such a person as would live up to my sense of indignation.” - Wuzu
        </i></p>
        <br>
        <p>  (Where did he go?)
        </p>
        <br>
        <p><i>Everywhere there are [supposed] teachers who cannot tell wrong from right.
        </i></p>
        <br>
        <p><i><b>When students come to ask them about bodhi and nirvana and the wisdoms of the three bodies of buddha, these blind teachers immediately give them explanations. If they are rebuked by the students, they give them a beating and say they have no sense of etiquette.
        </b></i></p>
        <br>
        <p><i>But since these [supposed] teachers have no eyes, they should not get mad at other people.
        </i></p>
        <br>
        <p><i><b>There are phony monks who do not know good from bad, who point to the east and call it the west, who entertain contradictory desires and love inscrutable sayings. Look and see if they do not bear the telltale marks of false teachers. They know some enlightenment stories [but not when to use them]. When students do not understand [such random instructions], the pretended teachers soon lose their tempers.
        </b></i></p>
        <br>
        <p><i>This type are all wild fox spirits and hideous monsters. They are laughed at by good students, who say to them: <b>"Blind old bald-pate slaves, you are confusing everyone in the world."</b>
        </i></p>
        <br>
        <p><i>You people of the Path, <b>those who leave home must learn the Path.</b> Take me for example. In the past I was concerned with the vinaya, and I also researched the sutras and sastras. Only later did I realize that these are medicines to cure the world, openly revealed explanations.
        </i></p>
        <br>
        <p><i><b>But then I put them aside for a time and went traveling to study Zen.</b> Later I met a great enlightened teacher [Huangbo] and only then did the eye of the Path become clear for me.
        </i></p>
        <br>
        <p><i><b>I began to understand the world’s teachers, and to know who was misguided and who was correct.
        </b></i></p>
        <br>
        <p><i><b>If you do not understand immediately when your mama gives birth to you, then you need direct experiential research, refining and polishing, until one morning there’s spontaneous insight.
        </b></i></p>
        <br>
        <p>"[I had not yet met] such a person as would live up to my sense of indignation.” ... "Good words"; as Foyan says.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>As a (former?) Phony Monk who studied countless esoteric texts and teachings, and paraded himself about, vigorously Stroking that Woke ... I exhort you all to also seek out such a person.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>Until you find them, don't go about "bulging your eyes" and parading around your superficial misunderstanding of The Family.

        <br>
        <p>But do feel free to ask questions and explore your search!
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>But not to me this time ... I'm just sharing this to cap off my morning.

        <h3><u>[BCR] "Yunmen's Every Day Is A Good Day"; Case 6</u>
        </h3>
        <h3>Green Sage</h3>
        <h3>2/23/2020</h3>
        <p><i>Case 6; Blue Cliff Record
        </i></p>
        <br>
        <p>GS NOTE: For those not familiar with the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_Cliff_Record">Blue Cliff Record (the “BCR”)</a>, it is a particular “arrangement” of 100 koans from around 1125 AD. In actuality it is a tool for providing “Instruction by Koan” … and students who are more comfortable with Zen should earnestly approach it as such … while newer students should just be aware that, while there are essentially "Zen memes” and other cultural and historical references that might go over your head, the final "point" of each koan is always within your realm of understanding. Whether you consider yourself new or experienced, the ultimate goal of koan study is to “pierce through” both the koan and your doubts, so all students should know that they can approach the BCR without fear.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>Newer students should seek set to aside their ignorance and clearly see straight through the case; more familiar students should try and put aside their knowledge, confront their doubt, and avoid over-intellectualizing their understanding. In the end though, it’s really about each individual’s personal relationship with the koan (and themselves); <b>so make it your own and don’t rush.</b>
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>And don’t feel afraid or ashamed to look things up or to ask questions either. The only “test” is the one you create for yourself. If that is your sort of thing, then perhaps the BCR is just the thing for you. In fact, this series on each koan is a personal "test" that I created for myself. So I guess thanks are in order to you as well for participating in that with me. <b>I've made as many research notes as I could with the hope that this will aide your own koan study by cutting down on time and labor and maybe adding some insight as well. Please feel free to share your thoughts and findings in the comments below!</b>
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>Here’s what you need to know about the setup of the book: everything except the cases and “verses” were written by <a href="https://terebess.hu/zen/Yuanwu.html">[Yuanwu Keqin]</a> (i.e., the "Notes" and the "Commentaries"); while the verses were written by <a href="https://terebess.hu/zen/Xuedou.html">[Xuedou]</a> who also compiled the cases together into the original “Record”. From time to time some of Xuedou’s comments are also included within the text of the case. At one point the BCR wood-block templates were burned by <a href="https://terebess.hu/zen/dahui.html">[Dahui]</a> ... so sometimes a section may be missing here or there.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>The translation I’m using was made by Thomas Cleary and J.C. Cleary. Some (but not all) <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wade%E2%80%93Giles">"Wade-Giles"</a> spelling has been converted to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinyin">"pinyin"</a> for better clarity.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>At times I may divide a case into two posts, but generally I’ll try to keep it as one. Within each post, all of my own comments will be indicated by a ”GS:”. As with most of my stuff, I will highlight what was salient to me (as well as for formatting purposes) and I'll comment as I may. Rarely, I may make very minor editorial changes to the Cleary translation; ideally the reader should hardly notice any difference. The above notwithstanding, I apologize in advance for any inaccuracies or bad analysis; please feel free to comment as you may.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p><b>Why am I doing this? In short: I love Zen, I love koans, and this is like a meditation/hobby for me; I hope you enjoy!

        <h3>~|~  INTRODUCTION  ~|~</h3>
        <br>
        <p>GS: The main feature of this case is one of my favorite sayings from Yunmen. But just as the 15th of the month has nothing to do with calendar dates, "good" has nothing to do with your preferences.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>So if you prefer "Every Day Is A Bad Day", well then that's your prerogative; that's your day.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>Still, nothing can stand up to Yunmen's "Good Day".
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>Have a nice day!
        </p>
        <br>
        <h3>~|~  CASE  ~|~</h3>
        <br>
        <p><i>Yunmen said, "I don't ask you about before the fifteenth day;[1] try to say something about after the fifteenth day."[2]</i></p>
        <br>
        <p><i>Yunmen himself answered for everyone, <b>"Every day is a good day."[3]</b></i></p>
        <br>
        <h3>~|~  NOTES  ~|~</h3>
        <br>
        <p><i>[1] Half south of the river, half north of the river. We don't keep old calendar dates here.
        </i></p>
        <p>GS: Yuanwu in his compassion gives us clues. Half above, half below; what do these all have in common?
        </p>
        <br>

        <p>GS: More compassion. With his first round he sent us north and south, now he sends us east and west. Even though words may come to you, it's not the tail that wags the dog; poetry about the dawn isn't what makes the sun rise.

        <p>GS: Yunmen's compassion is without comparison. Yuanwu's hints pale and my deceptive reassurances are put to shame. No one can leap free. "Every Day Is A Good Day" (EDIAGD). You might as well put it on bracelets and bumper-stickers because once even a ray of light from these words touches you, the light will never stop shining. If instead of sunlight you prefer moonlight, allow even one beam of Yuanwu's brilliance and the sun will never rise in that place again. As Yuanwu said: "we don't keep old calendar dates here"; EDIAGD. Don't stick by the zero point; ring the midnight bell at noon and the lunch bell at midnight. Whether or not you agree with Yunmen, the sun refuses to set on these words.

        <p>As for the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_water_deities#Sino-Tibetan/East_Asian_mythology">sea god</a>, that link is the best I could find without falling down a rabbit hole. We'd have to know what characters were used in the original text in order to pinpoint the particular deity being referenced here.

        <h3>~|~  COMMENTARY  ~|~</h3>
        <br>
        <p><i>Yunmen first called on <a href="https://terebess.hu/zen/muzhou.html">[Muzhou]</a>. Muzhou spun devices that turned like lightning, so it was difficult to approach and linger. Whenever he received someone, he would grab him as soon as he crossed the threshold and say, "Speak! Speak!" If he couldn't attempt a reply, he would push him out, saying, "Antique drill turning in a rut!"
        </i></p>
        <p>GS: At the bottom I will add some interesting info I found while researching it, but suffice it to say, in this case, per the parlance of its time, contemporary listeners/readers would have understood the specific words/characters used as a meme representing an "utterly useless device"; it references a quasi-legendary emperor (China's first) who was going to construct a special stone palace and had special drills made for that purpose, but he died before construction could begin and so the project was abandoned and the drills were never used ... rendering them utterly useless and irrelevant.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p><i>When Yunmen went to see Muzhou, on the third time, as soon as he knocked on the door, Muzhou said, "Who's there?" Yunmen answered, "[Me, Yunmen]." (Note: he wasn't "Yunmen" then; he just gave his regular name). As soon as (Muzhou) opened the door a little, (Yunmen) immediately bounded in; Muzhou held him fast and said, "Speak! Speak!" Yunmen hesitated, and was pushed out; he still had one foot inside when Muzhou slammed the door, breaking Yunmen's leg. As Yunmen cried out in pain, he was suddenly greatly enlightened. Subsequently, the trend of his words in dealing with people, his whole style, emerged from Muzhou. After this, Yunmen stayed for three years in the home of the ministry president Chen Cao.
        </i></p>
        <p>GS: A broken leg; what a price to pay for enlightenment, right? XD
        </p>
        <p>The Cleary Translation notes that Chen Cao was a student of Muzhou living in the area. I couldn't find much on him but I did find <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=0XbGDgAAQBAJ&pg=PA132&lpg=PA132&dq=%22chen+cao%22+zen&source=bl&ots=9wk6WB2k55&sig=ACfU3U2tww63pEOAsoSTgO-0vG9SIAogfQ&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjn4InLjbvnAhX9mHIEHaeoB78Q6AEwA3oECBUQAQ#v=onepage&q=%22chen%20cao%22%20zen&f=false">[this]</a>.

        <br>
        <p><i>Muzhou directed Yunmen to go to Xuefeng; when he arrived there, he came forth from the assembly and said, "What is Buddha?" Xuefeng said, "Don't talk in your sleep." Yunmen then bowed. He dwelt there for three years.
        </i></p>
        <br>
        <p><i>One day Xuefeng asked him, "What is your perception?"
        </i></p>
        <p><i>Yunmen said, "My view doesn't differ in the slightest from that of all the sages since antiquity."
        </i></p>
        <br>
        <p><i>For twenty years Lingshu did not appoint a head monk. He used to say, "My head monk is born," and "My head monk is tending oxen," and he would say, "My head monk is traveling on foot." Suddenly one day he ordered the bell to be struck (for everyone to assemble) to receive the head monk at the gate. The congregation was dubious about this, but Yunmen actually arrived. Lingshu immediately invited him into the head monk's quarters to unpack his bundle. People called Lingshu the Knowing Sage Chan Master, since he knew of all past and future events in advance.
        </i></p>
        <p>GS: I couldn't find much on "Lingshu" other than him being <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yunmen_Wenyan#Advanced_Zen-studies">["Lingshu Rumin"]</a>, the predecessor to Yunmen at the Lingshu temple in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rumin">Rumin</a>; and, according to Wiki, a "great friend" of Yunmen. I'm not completely sure what the point of Lingshu's apparent powers of clairvoyance is supposed to be, but I've noticed that in the texts such things usually seem to amount to some exaggeration of normal circumstances.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p><i>Once <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liu_Yan_(emperor">[King Liu, the Lord of Guan (-dong)]</a>, was going to mobilize his army; he intended to go to the monastery personally to ask the master (Lingshu) to determine whether conditions were auspicious or not. Lingshu, knowing of this beforehand, sat down and peacefully passed away. The Lord of Guan said angrily, "Since when was the master sick?" The attendant answered, "The master hadn't been sick. He had just entrusted a box (to me), which he ordered me to present to your majesty when you arrived." The Lord of Guan opened the box and took out a card which said, "The Eye of Humans and Gods (a living Buddha) is the head monk in the hall." Having understood Lingshu's inner meaning, the Lord of Guan thereupon dismissed his soldiers and invited Yunmen to appear in the world at Lingshu Monastery. Only later did he dwell at [Mt.] Yunmen.
        </i></p>
        <br>
        <p><i>As [Yunmen] was expounding the Dharma, the royal attendant Ru posed a question; "Is the fruit of Lingshu ('Spiritual Tree') ripe yet, or not?"
        </i></p>
        <p><i>Yunmen said, "When have you ever heard it said that it was unripe?"
        </i></p>
        <br>
        <p><i>One day King Liu summoned the master to spend the summer in the palace. Together with several other venerable abbots, he was to receive the questions of the courtiers and expound the Dharma. Only one man, the master Yunmen, did not speak, and there was no one on familiar terms with him. One of the palace functionaries wrote a verse and posted it in the Green Jade Hall:
        </i></p>
        <p><i>Cultivation of the great wisdom--only that is Chan;
        </i></p>
        <p><i>Silence, not clamor, is in order for the Chan school.
        </i></p>
        <p><i>Ten thousand kinds of clever talk--how can they be as good as reality?
        </i></p>
        <p><i>They lose to Yunmen's total not speaking.
        </i></p>
        <p>GS: Powerful.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p><i>Yunmen usually liked to teach three word Chan: (i) observing; (ii) "Reflect!"; [and] (iii) "Ha!"
        </i></p>
        <p><i>Translator's Note: "When Yunmen encountered someone, he would look at him and say, 'Reflect!' and 'Ha!' (a laugh of derision or scorn); later the word describing Yunmen's action was included by a compiler as one of the 'three words' he is supposed to have used."
        </i></p>
        <br>
        <p><i>He also taught one word Chan: a monk asked, "When you kill your father and mother, you repent before the Buddha; when you kill the Buddha and Patriarchs, where do you turn to repent?" Yunmen said, “Exposed." Again a monk asked, "What is the treasury of the eye of the true Dharma?" Yunmen said, "Universal." It just doesn't allow any attempts to explain. In ordinary situations, even, Yunmen would still revile people. When he uttered a phrase, it was like an iron spike.
        </i></p>
        <p>GS: "Exposed"; "Universal"; ... you pretty much know what he means but you don't know exactly what he means ... and he won't provide you with any confirmation. You'll have to make up your mind for yourself ... almost as if that's the point!
        </p>
        <br>
        <p><i>Later Yunmen produced the Four Sages: <a href="https://terebess.hu/zen/Dongshan-Shouchu.html">[Dongshan Shouchu]</a>, Zhimen Shiguan, <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=QPn_8kKS3SAC&pg=PA324&lpg=PA324&dq=deshan+yuanming&source=bl&ots=nyZYPtCBRE&sig=ACfU3U2vgCeblErNQgZ9_E0qIUjUA4tAEg&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjW39Cyl73nAhW7kHIEHfxmAxcQ6AEwAnoECBQQAQ#v=onepage&q=deshan%20yuanming&f=false">[Deshan Yuanmi]</a>, and Xianglin Dengyuan. They all were great masters of the school. Xianglin served as Yunmen's attendant for eighteen years; whenever Yunmen dealt with him, he would just call out, "Attendant Yuan!" Yuan would answer, "Yes?" Yunmen would say, "What is it?" It went on like this for eighteen years, when one day Hsiang Lin finally awakened. Yunmen told him, "From now on I won't call you any more."
        </i></p>
        <p>GS: Info on the "Four Sages" was hard to find ... even what scant information I found wasn't revealing. There was a reference to the "Four Sages of Chan" in Journey to the West, but otherwise, it appears that [this] was the ancient template.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p><i>In Yunmen's usual dealings with people, he would often use the methods of Muzhou; though it was hard to approach him, he had the hammer and tongs, to pull out nails and wrench out pegs. Xuedou said of him, "I like the fresh devices of [Yunmen] he spent his life pulling out nails and pegs for people."
        </i></p>
        <p>GS: All the ancients were like this. The human mind is tricky and clever ... for yourself and for others. The pegs must be pulled out to allow for freedom of movement. I tried to find more information on this "peg and nail" terminology, but [this] was the best breadcrumb that I could find.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p><i>Yunmen set down a question to instruct his community, "I don't ask you about before the fifteenth day; try to say something about after the fifteenth day." He cuts off the thousand distinctions, and doesn't let either ordinary or holy pass. He himself answered for everyone, "Every day is a good day." The words "before the fifteenth day" already cut off the thousand distinctions; the words "after the fifteenth day" also cut off the thousand distinctions. The fact is that Yunmen did not say that the next day is the sixteenth day. People coming after him merely followed his words to produce interpretations; but what relevance has this? Yunmen established a protean style; he surely had a way to benefit people. Having spoken some words, he then answered himself on everyone's behalf: "Every day is a good day." These words pervade past and present, from before until after, and settle everything at once.
        </i></p>
        <p><i>I too am following his words to produce interpretations when I talk like this. Killing others is not as good as killing yourself. As soon as you make a principle, you fall into a pit. Three phrases are inherent in every one phrase of Yunmen; since the source inspiration of his family is like this, when Yunmen utters a phrase, it must be returned to the source. Anything but this will always be phony. The affair has no multitude of arguments and propositions, though those who have not yet penetrated want (me as commentator) to go on like this. If you do penetrate, then you will immediately see the essential meaning of the Ancient [(Yunmen)].
        </i></p>
        <br>
        <p><i>Take a look at the complications Xuedou creates:

        </h3>
        <br>
        <p><i>Xuedou's eulogies of the Ancients were always accomplished like this: at first he takes the jewel sword of the Diamond King and brings it down at once; then afterwards he reveals a little bit of formal style. Although it's like this, ultimately there are not two understandings.
        </i></p>
        <p><i>"He throws away one, picks up seven." People often make an understanding based on the numbers and say, "'He throws away one' refers to 'before the fifteenth day'." Having abruptly put down two lines and sealed it up, Xuedou then instead reveals it to let people see; "He throws away one, picks up seven." You must avoid turning to the words for your subsistence. Why? What moisture is there in unleavened bread? People often fall back into conceptual consciousness. You must obtain your understanding before the words arise; then the great function will become manifest and you will naturally see it.
        </i></p>
        <p>GS: I tried to find something more substantial on this numerology but in the end, I think it just means what you probably think it means; seven is a number of completeness and all this other crap, blah, blah, blah ... it all comes down to the same thing: long and short; black and white; up and down. It was a funny experience to try and hunt down the source of this only to return to Yuanwu's word(s): "You must avoid turning to the words for your subsistence." haha
        </p>
        <br>
        <p><i>This is why after old man <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gautama_Buddha">[Shakyamuni]</a> had attained the Path in the land of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magadha">Magadha</a>, he spent three weeks contemplating this matter: "The nature of all things being quiescent extinction cannot be conveyed by words; I would rather not preach the Dharma, but quickly enter nirvana." When he got to this point, even Shakyamuni couldn't find any way to open his mouth. But by virtue of his power of skill in technique, after he had preached to the <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=qwBwDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA32&lpg=PA32&dq=%22the+five+mendicants%22&source=bl&ots=xD7jW7zQFZ&sig=ACfU3U3F6SBFqqvDDK2m0yB5zmIXq16OTw&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwidzNjErt7nAhWVlHIEHaDuAKYQ6AEwAnoECA0QAQ#v=onepage&q=%22the%20five%20mendicants%22&f=false">five mendicants</a>, he went to three hundred and sixty assemblies and expounded the teachings for his age. All these were just expedients. For this reason he had taken off his bejewelled regal garments and put on rough dirty clothing.
        </i></p>
        <p><i>[Shakyamuni] could could not but turn towards the shallows within the gate of the secondary meaning in order to lead in his various disciples. If we had him face upwards and bring it all up at once, there would hardly be anyone in the whole world (who could understand).
        </i></p>
        <p><i>But tell me, what is the supreme word? At this point Xuedou reveals a little of the meaning to let people see.
        </i></p>
        <p><i>Just don't see that there are any buddhas above, don't see that there are sentient beings below; don't see that there are mountains, rivers, and earth without, and don't see that there are seeing, hearing, discernment, or knowledge within: then you will be like one who has died the great death and then returned to life. With long and short, good and evil, fused into one whole, though you bring them up one by one, you'll no longer see them as different.
        </i></p>
        <p><i>After that, you'll be able to function responsively without losing balance. Then you will see the meaning of his saying, "He throws away one, picks up seven; above, below, and in the four directions, there is no comparison." If you pass through at these lines, then and there above, below, and in the four directions, there is no comparison. The myriad forms and multitude of appearances--plants, animals, and people--everything everywhere completely manifests the way of your own house. Thus it was said:
        </i></p>
        <br>
        <p><i><b>Within myriad forms, only one body is revealed;
        </b></i></p>
        <p><i><b>Only when one is sure for himself will he then be near.
        </b></i></p>
        <p><i><b>In past years I mistakenly turned to the road to search;
        </b></i></p>
        <p><i><b>Now I look upon it like ice within fire.
        </b></i></p>
        <br>
        <p><i>"In the heavens and on earth, I alone am the honored one." Many people pursue the branches and don't seek the root. First get the root right, then naturally when the wind blows the grass bends down, naturally where water flows a stream forms.
        </i></p>
        <p><i>"Placidly walking along, he treads down the sound of the flowing stream." As he goes along placidly, he can tread down and cut off even the roar of a vast swelling torrent. "His relaxed gaze descries the tracks of flying birds." Even if it's the tracks of flying birds, allow the eye one look, and it is like tracing them out.
        </i></p>
        <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eakKfY5aHmY">GS: Beautiful. Say 'hello' to your mind.
        </a></p>
        <br>
        <p><i>When you get here, you will not consider it difficult to blow out the fires under the cauldrons of hell, or to shatter sword forests and knife mountains with a shout.
        </i></p>
        <p><i>Because of his compassion, at this point Xuedou feared that people would settle down within the realm of unconcern, so he went on to say, "The grasses grow thick, the mists overhang." But tell me, whose world is this? Can it be called "Every day is a good day"? Fortunately, there's no connection.
        </i></p>
        <p>GS: I always love when Yuanwu says this! Haha it's like rejoicing in the stands at the same time as a gladiator cuts your head off with one stroke in the pit.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p><i>In fact, "Placidly walking along, he treads down the sound of the flowing stream" isn't it; "His relaxed gaze descries the tracks of flying birds" isn't it either; nor is "The grasses grow thick," nor "The mists overhang." But even something entirely different would just be <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=XKTmmaScCGcC&pg=PA214&lpg=PA214&dq=subhuti+and+flowers&source=bl&ots=Bp0UItECt5&sig=ACfU3U3B3x7FlwZz3ywxt-Q4H9_RKxJY0A&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwij4NfLwtDnAhXPmeAKHZvnD2wQ6AEwEHoECBMQAQ#v=onepage&q=subhuti%20and%20flowers&f=false">"Round Subhuti's cliff, the flowers make a mess."</a> It is still necessary to turn beyond That Side. Haven't you read how as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subh%C5%ABti">[Subhuti]</a> was sitting in silent meditation in a cliffside cave, the gods showered down flowers to praise him. The venerable Subhuti said, "Flowers are showering down from the sky in praise; whose doing is this?" A god said, "I am <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indra">[Indra]</a>, king of the gods." Venerable Subhuti asked, "Why are you offering praise?" Indra said, "I esteem the Venerable One's skill in expounding the transcendence of wisdom." Subhuti said, "I have never spoken a single word about wisdom; why are you offering praise?" Indra said, "You have never spoken and I have never heard. No speaking, no hearing-this is true wisdom." And again he caused the earth to tremble, and showered down flowers.
        </i></p>
        <p>GS: What a mess! I couldn't find many sources on Subhuti's flower shower beyond what I linked; and I couldn't find anything outside of the Zen tradition with the exact same story. In fact, the best alternative source I could find was Case 19 of the BCR.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p><i>Xuedou once made up another verse about this:
        </i></p>
        <p><i><b>The rain has passed, the clouds are shrinking, dawn has halfway broken through;
        </b></i></p>
        <p><i><b>The multiple peaks are like a drawing of blue-green rocky crags.

        <p><i><b>Subhuti did not know how to sit upon a cliff;

        <p><i><b>He brought on the heavenly flowers and the shaking of the earth.

        <br>
        <p><i>When the king of gods is shaking the earth and raining down flowers, at this point where else will you go to hide? Xuedou also said,

        <p><i><b>I fear Subhuti won't be able to escape him;
        </b></i></p>

        <p><i>Though you be clean and naked, bare and purified, totally without fault or worry, this is still not the ultimate. In the end though, what is? Look carefully at this quote: "I snap my fingers; how lamentable is Shunyata!" The Sanskrit word <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C5%9A%C5%ABnyat%C4%81">"Shunyata"</a> in our language means the spirit of emptiness. Empty space is her body; she has no physical body to be conscious of contact. When the Buddha's brilliance shines forth, then she manifests her body. When you get to be like Shunyata, then Xuedou will rightly snap his fingers in lament. Again Xuedou says, "Don't make a move!" What's it like when you move? (Like) sleeping with your eyes open under the bright sun in the blue sky.
        </i></p>
        <p><i>Translator's Note: "Snapping the fingers is used for alerting, warning, and for warding off filth or taboo. Abiding in subjective emptiness is referred to as intoxication in Chan, considered onesided, incomplete, and narrow-minded; hence it is taboo."

        <p>With regard to the "antique drill, turning in a rut" I was somewhat intrigued to find that the best source I could dig up which really fully explained it was from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jimmy_Yu">[Guo Gu]</a> who you may remember from the <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/eo51wv/hi_im_guo_gu_a_zenchan_teacher_founder_of/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=usertext&utm_name=zen&utm_content=t3_f8deac">AMA</a> he recently did on Reddit. I'm not gonna say I didn't find any issues with <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Passing-Through-Gateless-Barrier-Practice/dp/1611802814/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=guo+gu&qid=1582385820&sr=8-1">his treatment of the Wumenguan</a> (mostly what you would expect) ... but so far I have really liked it and I do recommend it as a resource. Here's what he says about the "antique drill":
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>"Every Chinese person in premodern times would have knwon what that meant. In 221 B.C.E., <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qin_Shi_Huang">[Qin Shi Huang (260-210 B.C.E.)]</a> became the first emperor to unify China. To improve communications throughout China, or more accurately, so that he could communicate universally throughout his empire, Qin Shi Huang unified Chinese script from the many different forms used in writing. It was during that period that the wheel was invented, and it was he who began to build the Great Wall of China. His last project idea was to erect a magnificent stone palace for himself. In order to build his palace, a drill strong enough to penetrate and carve stone had to be invented. As the great palace did not get built before Qin Shi Huang's death, the stone drills became useless.

        <p>I wanted to see if I could track down an origin for the phrase, "He throws away one, picks up seven," but I couldn't find anything reliable. Which I think is pretty cool, especially given Yuanwu's words here, telling us to not even bother. (Maybe I should have listened? lol). I say that because it seems to be exactly as it appears: a nod to "all" and "one"; an original creation, not meant to be conceptualized and instead left for you to decide for yourself. For those with Chinese-language proficiency, here are the <a href="http://ntireader.org/words/105890.html">breadcrumbs</a> though, if you want to follow them.

        <h3><u>(Linji) The Golden Lion Lays the Smack Down</u>
        </h3>
        <h3>Green Sage</h3>
        <h3>2/18/2020</h3>
        <p>(Record of Linji; Cleary translation)</p>
        <p><i>“Good people, you hurry around everywhere, but what are you seeking? You have worn your soles flat. There is no Buddha that can be sought, no Path that can be achieved, no Dharma that can be attained. If you seek outside for a buddha with form, it is not like the real you.&quot;
        &quot;Do you want to know your fundamental mind? It’s neither merged with nor apart from [birth and death, karmic consciousness].&quot;
        &quot;The real Buddha is formless, the real Path has no body, the real Dharma has no marks. The three are fused together, joined in one place. But since you cannot discern this, you are just ordinary, busy, confused sentient beings [in the grips] of karmic consciousness.”
        (GS: A challenge)</i></p>
        <br>
        <p><i>Someone asked Linji: “What are the real Buddha, the real Dharma, and the real Path? Please instruct us.”
        Linji said: &quot;Buddha is the mind’s purity. Dharma is the mind’s light. The Path is the pure light that is unobstructed everywhere.&quot;
        &quot;The three are one. All three are empty names, not real. For genuine people of the Path, this mind is not interrupted from moment to moment.&quot;
        “When the great teacher Bodhidharma came from India, he was just looking for people who do not accept other people’s delusions. Later he met the Second Patriarch, who understood at a single word, and finally realized that up till then he had been making his efforts in vain.&quot;
        “The way I see today is no different from the buddhas and patriarchs. If you get it at the first phrase, you are a teacher to buddhas and patriarchs. If you get it at the second phrase, you are a teacher of humans and devas. If you get it at the third phrase, you cannot even save yourself.”</i></p>
        <br>
        <p>(GS: A test ... and a truth. Which phrase is this?)</p>
        <br>
        <p>(And for comparison, the Sasaki translation:)</p>
        <br>
        <p><i>“Virtuous monks, what are you seeking as you go around hither and yon, walking until the soles of your feet are flat? There is no buddha to seek, no Way to complete, no dharma to attain.&quot;
        &quot;If you seek outside for a buddha having form,
        You won’t find him to resemble you;
        If you know your own original mind,
        It’s neither united with nor apart from [him].&quot;
        “Followers of the Way, true buddha has no shape, true Way has no substance, true dharma has no form; these three are fused together harmoniously united into one. Just because you can’t understand this, you’re called ‘sentient beings with unlimited karmic consciousness’.”
        Someone asked, “What about the true buddha, the true dharma, and the true Way? We beg of you to disclose this for us.”
        The master said, “Buddha is the mind’s purity; dharma is the mind’s radiance; the Way is the pure light pervading everywhere without hindrance.&quot;</i></p>
        <br>
        <p><i>
        &quot;The three are one, yet all are empty names and have no real existence. With the true man of the Way, from moment to moment mind is not interrupted.&quot;
        “From the time the great teacher Bodhidharma came from the Western Land, he just sought a man who would not accept the deluded views of others. Later, he met the Second Patriarch, who, having understood at [Bodhidharma’s] one word, for the first time realized that hitherto he had been futilely engaged in striving.&quot;
        “As for my understanding today, it’s no different from that of the patriarch-buddhas. He who attains at the First Statement becomes the teacher of patriarch-buddhas; he who attains at the Second Statement becomes the teacher of men and gods; he who attains at the Third Statement cannot save even himself.”</i></p>

            <br>
            <p><i>“To misinterpret the Dharma and make a mistake yourself might be acceptable, but to exhort others to do the same is unacceptable. In your own confusion you do not see, and, moreover you slander the Buddha’s Sutras. Therefore no-thought is established as the doctrine. “Good Knowing Advisors, why is no-thought established as the doctrine? Because there are confused people who speak of seeing their own nature, and yet they produce thought with regard to states. Their thoughts cause deviant views to arise, and from that all defilement and false thinking are created. Originally, not one single dharma can be obtained in the self-nature. If there is something to attain, or false talk of misfortune and blessing, that is just defilement and deviant views. Therefore, this Dharma-door establishes no-thought as its doctrine.</i></p>
            <p>English translation by the Buddhist Text Translation Society</p>
            <br>
            <p><i>“Good friends, why is it that nonthought is taken as the central doctrine? If you depend merely on oral explanations of seeing the nature, [like a] deluded person you will have thoughts relative to the realms and you will even activate false views regarding those thoughts. And from this will be generated all the enervating defilements and false thoughts! There is in the self-nature fundamentally not a single dharma that can be perceived. To think that there were any would be a false explanation, a disaster, a false view of enervating defilements. Therefore, this teaching takes nonthought as its central doctrine.</i></p>

            <br>
            <p><i>If you do not know the intention of the teaching, you go wrong yourself, and can also mislead others. Your self-delusion is not visible to you. You even misrepresent Buddhist scriptures. That is why we establish freedom from thought as the source.

                Good friends, how do we establish freedom from thought as the source? Deluded people who only talk about seeing essential nature have thoughts about objects, then create false views based on these thoughts; all worldly troubles and erroneous ideas come from this. In our own essential nature there is basically not a single thing that can be grasped. If you grasp anything supposedly bad or good, this is worldly trouble, a false view. Therefore this teaching establishes freedom from thought as the source.</i></p>

        <h3><u>(Foyan) "Seeing Mind"</u></h3>
        <h3>Green Sage</h3>
        <h3>1/04/2020</h3>
        <p><i>(Foyan, Instant Zen)</i></p>
        <br>
        <h3>~|~  Introduction  ~|~
        </h3>
        <br>
        <p>GS: I recently got Foyan’s Instant Zen on audio through Audible and it really drove something home for me: hearing someone talk about Zen and reading Zen are vastly different. Multiple times it has occurred that in listening to the audio, something strikes me profoundly, but then in searching the text I have a tough time finding the passage. When I do, it takes a while for my memory of the spoken word to “sync up” with my reading of it. It can often seem like two totally different passage! For that reason, I not only urge you to get this particular book on audio, but to further consider this extra dimension of Zen study.</p>
        <br>
        <p>There was a prominent member of this community (who has now since exiled himself) who recorded some excellent readings of Huangbo. He took them down for his own “personal” reasons but in the months since I have markedly noted their absence. At first I just figured it was an “attachment” but now it is obvious that there was “something” there.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>So listen to audio. Or real people.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>All that said, I think Foyan is amazing but I have said many times that I think he is deceptively simple for non-advanced students. Setting aside any arguments you want to throw at me about gradualism, it is the realization which is sudden and un-graduated; logically, “unravelling” of preconceptions will require a process that will not be the same for everyone. I think Foyan is "too good" in that, he can help an advanced student get "all the way through" but a newer student might read Foyan and think "aw yeah I've got this!" when in reality they've stumbled past.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>Eh, whatever.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>That all said, I think in the spoken word, Foyan comes through more clearly, but I’m sharing this passage today because I find it to be a particularly clear exhortation of what to look for, what not to look for, and what to watch out for!
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>One of my favorite parts is his anecdote about falling in the mud. I think every student goes through some moment like that, where they feel that they are “failing” in their apprehension of Zen and wonder why they are still suffering even if they “get it.”
        </p>
        <br>
        <h3>~|~  Text  ~|~
        </h3>
        <br>
        <p><i>As soon as you rationalize, it’s hard to understand; you must refrain from rationalization before you can attain realization.
        </i></p>
        <br>
        <p><i>Hearing such talk, some people immediately declare, “I have nothing to say at all, and no reason either.” They do not realize this is in fact a rationalization!
        </i></p>
        <br>
        <p><i>I will settle something for you right now: the ultimate rule is to see your own mind clearly. This is what Buddhism is, as far as I am concerned.
        </i></p>
        <br>
        <p><i>An ancient said, “The mind does not know itself, the mind does not see itself.” So how can you see it clearly?
        </i></p>
        <br>
        <p><i>Even though it’s your own mind, it’s hard to see. All the sages since time immemorial have been people who clearly saw their own minds. My late teacher was someone who saw his own mind, but among those here who were also associated with him in the past, there are very few who clearly see their own minds.
        </i></p>
        <br>
        <p><i>Mind does not see mind; to get it, you must not see it as mind. This is a realm apart from thoughts.
        </i></p>
        <br>
        <p><i>Now if I say this to people, they think I am criticizing everyone else, but if I do not talk about it, it will be hard to elucidate. Zen teachers of a certain type say to people, “Fools! Why don’t you understand this thing?” First they make a cliché of “your own mind,” then try to use the mind to realize it. This is called driving a spike into a stump and then running round and round the stump. They pass it on this way, and it is taken up this way, knocking on their chairs and holding up their whisks. This is called trying to use the mind by means of the mind.
        </i></p>
        <br>
        <p><i>There is another type of Zen teacher who tells people not to make logical assessments, that they lose contact the minute they speak, and should recognize the primordial. This kind of “teacher” has no explanation at all. This is like sitting on a balloon— where is there any comfort in it? It is also like the croaking of a bullfrog. If you entertain such a view, it is like being trapped in a black fog.
        </i></p>
        <br>
        <p><i>I am exhorting you in utter seriousness; I am not lying, I am not making up rationalizations to trap people, I will not allow people to oppress the free. I have no such reasons. If you recognize this, that is up to you. If you say you also see this way, that is up to you. If you say that everything is all right according to your perception, that is up to you. If you say your mind is still uneasy, that is up to you.
        </i></p>
        <br>
        <p><i>....You can only attain realization if you don’t deceive yourself....
        </i></p>
        <br>
        <p><i>There are quite a few Zen teachers in the world, talking about Zen, talking about Dao. Do you think they are self-deceived, or not self-deceived? Do you think they are deceiving others, or not deceiving others? It is imperative to discern minutely.
        </i></p>
        <br>
        <p><i>In the old days, when I was in the school of my late teacher, I once accepted an invitation to go somewhere. On the way I ran into a downpour and slipped in the mud. Feeling annoyed, I said to myself, “I am on the journey but have been unable to attain Zen. I haven’t eaten all day, and now have to endure this misery too!” Then I happened to hear two people ranting at each other, “You’re still annoying yourself!” When I heard this, I suddenly felt overjoyed. Then I realized I couldn’t find the state where there is no annoyance. That was because I couldn’t break through my feeling of doubt. It took me four or five years after that to attain this knowledge.
        </i></p>
        <br>
        <p><i>Now you should exercise your attention in this way. I have brought up the saying that inanimate things teach, but many are those who misunderstand. When you see inanimate things, you say they’re inanimate, and when you see animate beings you consider them animate.
        </i></p>
        <br>
        <p><i>If you who study Zen do not understand the teaching of the inanimate, how can you understand the task of the journey? If those who act as teachers do not understand the teaching of the inanimate, how can they deal with people in beneficial ways?
        </i></p>
        <br>
        <p><i>I urge you to examine closely enough to effect an awakening. If you do not yet have an awakened perspective, then approach it in a relaxed manner; do not rush.
        </i></p>

        <h3><u>Not Preaching a Doctrine (Hui-neng's commentary on the diamond sutra)</u></h3>
            <h3>Royal Salt Merchant</h3>
            <h3>12/26/2019</h3>
            <p><i>Talking about emptiness all day does not say a single word. If you say he has a doctrine, you are slandering the Realized One. Therefore the sutra follows up with a section on not preaching a doctrine.</i></p>
            <br>
            <p><i><b>"Subhuti, do not say that the Realized One entertains this thought: 'I should preach some doctrine.' Do not entertain this thought. Why? If any say the Realized One preaches any doctrine, they are slandering the Buddha, because they cannot understand what I say. Subhuti, the explanation of the teaching is that there is no doctrine to preach---that is called teaching."</b></i></p>
            <br>
            <p><i>When ordinary people preach, they have a sense of accomplishment. Therefore the Buddha tells Subhuti that when the Realized One teaches, he has no sense of accomplishment. Ordinary people preach with a sense of being able to understand. The Realized One's speech and silence are both spontaneous; the words he utters are like echoes responding to sounds, occurring naturally without deliberate intent, not the same as the ordinary man preaching with a fluctuating mind. If any say that the Realized One preaches with fluctuating in his mind, they are slandering Buddha. The Sutra of Vimalakirti says, "Real teaching involves no preaching, no giving orders; you realized that myriad things are empty, and all names and words are temporary setups; constructed within inherent emptiness, all the verbal expositions explain that all realities are signless and unfabricated, thus guiding deluded people in such a way as to get them to see their original nature and cultivate and realized unsurpassed enlightenment.</i></p>

            <p>"all names and words are temporary setups"</p>
            <br>
            <p>I often see many get hung up on exact definitions or meanings of particular phrases etc. seeking to understand through an intellectual pursuit of the dharma. They may be confusing the finger pointing at the moon with the actual moon. There are many modern teachers who have made it their business to convince others to be hung up on mantras or one idea/concept but when we can look at these zen texts and remember that real teaching involves no preaching and no giving orders!</p>

        <p><i>23. Q: If I follow this Way, and refrain from intellectual processes and conceptual thinking, shall I be certain of attaining the goal? A: Such non-intellection IS following the Way! Why this talk of attaining and not attaining? The matter is thus--by thinking of something you create an entity and by thinking of nothing you create another. Let such erroneous thinking perish utterly, and then nothing will remain for you to go seeking!</i></p>

        <p>a little from HuangPo "on the transmission of mind" QandA (translation by Blofeld) or as I like to call him (Blofish)</p>

        <h3><u>Huineng (Platform Sutra) more on criticism of practicing sitting</u></h3>
        <h3>Royal Salt Merchant</h3>
        <h3>12/14/2019</h3>
        <p><i>The master said, “How does your master teach his followers?”</i></p>
        <br>
        <p><i>[Zhicheng] answered, “He always teaches his congregation to ‘fix the mind to contemplate purity and sit constantly without lying down.’”</i></p>
        <br>
        <p><i>The master said, “To ‘fix the mind to contemplate purity’ is a sickness not meditation. How could it benefit the principle to ‘sit constantly’ with a rigid body?
        </i></p>
        <br>
        <p><i>Listen to my verse: You can sit [in meditation] without lying down from the day you’re born, But when you die you will lie down and not sit up. One always has this putrid skeleton, Why should one set such a task?</i></p>
        <br>
        <p><i>Zhicheng did obeisance again and said, “When I was at Great Master Shenxiu’s, I studied the Way for nine years without achieving enlightenment. Now I have heard one explanation by Your Reverence and I have conformed to (i.e., become enlightened to) the fundamental mind.</i></p>
        <br>
        <p>The way is instant and complete. Sitting is not the way</p>

        <h3><u>What Huineng (6p) would have to say in regards to practice such as zazen (Platform Sutra)</u></h3>
        <h3>Royal Salt Merchant</h3>
        <h3>12/13/2019</h3>
        <p><i>“The deluded person is attached to the characteristics of dharmas and grasps onto the samādhi of the single practice, merely saying that he always sits without moving and without falsely activating the mind and that this is the samādhi of the single practice. To have an interpretation such as this is to be the same as an insentient object! This is rather to impede the causes and conditions of enlightenment!" (Platform Sutra 353a)
        </i></p>
        <br>
        <p>In contrast, what Dogen says in his shobogenzo is not in line with Huineng:</p>
        <br>
        <p><i>"In sum, descendants of the Buddha’s Ancestors need to explore through their training with their Master that seated meditation is undoubtedly the one Great Matter. This is the genuine seal that is Transmitted directly, one-to-one." (Shobogenzo, section 26)</i></p>
